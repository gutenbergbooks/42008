<h2><a name="TELLING_FORTUNES_BY" id="TELLING_FORTUNES_BY"></a>TELLING FORTUNES BY
CARDS</h2>


<p>The art of telling fortunes by cards, known professionally
as <span class="smcap">Cartomancy</span>, has been practiced for
centuries.</p>

<p>In our day and generation divination by cards
is chiefly employed for amusement and pastime, for
the entertainment of one's self or one's company, or
at church fairs, charity bazars, and the like; but in
the days of the ancients it was practiced by
prophets and sibyls as a serious business, and so
accepted by all, from king to peasant.</p>

<p>Certainly there were some remarkable coincidences,
to call them by no other name, in the fulfillment
of many cartomantic divinations, of which
history maintains a record. To cite but one:</p>



<h3>THE STORY OF JOSEPHINE, EMPRESS OF THE FRENCH.</h3>


<p>Josephine Tascher de la Pagerie, while in her
native land of Martinique, had been approached
by an aged negress, who astonished her through declaring
to her: "You will ascend upon the loftiest
throne in the world."</p>

<p>Always treasuring the memory of this prediction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Josephine, when the widow of Gen. Beauharnais,
during the bitter days of the Reign of Terror, was
induced to consult a distinguished seeress of the
Faubourg St. Germain, who relied upon cartomancy
as a means for elucidating the mysteries of the past,
present, and future. Although her visitor was disguised
as a waiting woman, the seeress, through a
simple resort to her pack of cards, read most correctly
the entire past existence of her consultant.
Then, by the same means, she laid bare the gloomy
picture of Josephine's present situation; how the
prison doors of the Luxembourg stood ready to receive
her; how the guillotine thirsted for her life's
blood; how, nevertheless, she would be saved from
all these impending dangers through intercession of
a young soldier, to her at the time personally a
stranger. Subsequently, by a fresh appeal to her
cards, the seeress threw aside the veil obscuring
Josephine's future destiny, predicting her marriage,
the onward march of her husband towards fame and
power, until finally, after a studious observation of
the cards, the cartomancian announced to her skeptical
consultant that on a given day, within the
cathedral church of Notre Dame, the unknown man
she was destined to marry would place upon her
head an imperial diadem, and furthermore that she
would be hailed, in the presence of the highest ecclesiastical
potentate on earth, as "Empress of the
French," and as such would be respected until her
death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The remarkably rapid and literal fulfillment of
the predictions made by a professional seeress to
an unknown lady, to whom she promised the most
exalted of mortal positions, not only astonished
the crowd of courtiers, wonder-stricken at realization
of this indisputable and well-authenticated
augury of miraculous events; but elicited the attention
of men of intellect and of science, hundreds of
whom visited the remarkable prophetess, and in
every instance testified to the accuracy of her predictions,
although at a loss to comprehend the
source from whence she attained apparently super-human
knowledge. It appeared wonderful to these
men of science that the mere combination of a series
of cards, which they had been accustomed to look
upon as a mere species of diversion, could be employed
as well to read the past as to penetrate the
mysteries of the future; still they were compelled,
in an elaborate report made to the Emperor, whose
comprehensive mind yearned after explanation of
all secrets, mental as well as physical, to state that,
while unable to account for the cause for this prophetic
knowledge, there could be no rational doubt
of its existence.</p>




<h3>RESEARCHING GYPSY LORE.</h3>


<p>This present treatise on the subject of divination
by cards is a gathering together in handy form of
the best authenticated methods of its ancient practice
as handed down from the Romany gypsies and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the seeresses that antedate them. As different nations
and different times had their varying interpretations
of the values of the cards and separate
and distinct methods of laying the cards for readings,
as well as fundamental differences in their
interpretations of the many possible combinations
of the various cards, we have decided to lay before
you in this work a complete symposium of each,
that the reader and student of the art may see before
him all the approved methods of the past and
choose intelligently that which best pleases or suits
his convenience.</p>

<p>All the old and many of the recent authors that
have been consulted in the preparation of this book
have been found to insist that divination through
playing-cards is to be relied upon as a truthful
exposition of the past and future and a veritable
portent of the future. They desire to be taken
seriously. The present editor has no desire to detract
from this position if it be a fact, nor does he
know that it is not a fact. His part in this work
is that of editor, and there ends. Here he presents
you with the results of centuries of effort on
the part of those who profess to believe sincerely
in what they practice and teach, and leaves the
reader to place as much or as little credence in the
truthfulness of their divinations as he chooses.</p>

<p>Certainly there is a wonderful fascination in the
mastering of Cartomancy, in the being able to tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
fortunes by the chance falling of the cards into
this or that position, and in knowing what each card
and grouping is believed to signify in their relations
to the person consulting.</p>



<h3>HOW TO ACQUIRE THE ART.</h3>


<p>The would-be adept is advised to study in detail
every word in this book, as he would any other lesson
he desired to master. Learn the various methods
of dealing and of reading the layout; consult
the several interpretations of the meanings and
learn to apply them, first in reading your own fortune
and later that of friends,&mdash;this only after you
have memorized many of the meanings and acquired
a degree of fluency in elaborating the "talk" or
"patter" that goes with a successful "reading."</p>

<p>No prophet or seer ever professed that divination
by cards is a natural gift. It is universally recognized
as being solely the result of study and practice,
and can be mastered by anyone who has this
book and gives the subject a little thought and sufficient
experimental, practical test to acquire proficiency.</p>




<h3>CARDS TO BE USED IN TELLING FORTUNES.</h3>


<p>While any ordinary pack of playing cards sold
in the usual stores can be used, it is best to secure,
if possible, a pack whose face cards have only a
single head, inasmuch as when, in dealing, cards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
come out reversed they bear a different signification
in some cases, than when upright. When, however,
the usual double-headed cards are used it is only
necessary to make a distinctive mark on the top
end of the faces of certain ones to secure the same
result as though the special fortune-telling pack
were employed. This mark may be a simple dot or
cross with pencil or pen, and should be made at one
end of the card only, which will then become the top
of the card in all cases, and cards coming out in the
deal with this mark at their tops will be considered
as upright, and with the marked end down, as reversed.
The only cards that need to be thus distinguished
are: The face cards of each suit; the
ace, eight, nine and ten of diamonds. (The spot
cards below the seven in any suit are, in most cases,
not used. Where they are employed, their reversal
has no significance.) The top of the seven of diamonds,
and the other suits, is considered to be the
end that has the extra central pip. Spot cards of
the three suits other than diamonds usually require
no mark to determine their top or bottom. The
"handles" of all spades and clubs, and the sharp
points of all hearts, point downward when those
cards are upright; hence when they point upward
the cards are considered as reversed. If, however,
any other cards than those here mentioned are so
printed as to make it difficult to distinguish the top
from the base, you should mark them at the top.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>




<h3>THE ONE SPECIAL CARD&mdash;THE CONSULTANT.</h3>


<p>In some of the methods of fortune-telling by
cards it is essential to have a special card as the
representative of the party seeking the response of
the oracle. This is commonly called the "Consultant."
If there is a joker in your pack, or an
extra blank card, as is the case in many packs, use
one of them as the Consultant, marking this card to
show which is its top, as its reversal has its own
signification. If there is neither joker nor blank
card, use the discarded deuce of either suit in the
pack, with a mark at its top end.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_ANCIENT_ORACLE" id="THE_ANCIENT_ORACLE"></a>THE ANCIENT ORACLE</h2>


<p>Various meanings have been ascribed to the individual
cards in different countries and times, several
lists of which, and they the known standards of the
art, are given throughout this book. The first list
of interpretations that we present is from a very
ancient work, first published in 1600 or a little later.
This, it will be noticed, defines the entire fifty-two
cards of the pack and has no separate signification
for any card being upright or reversed; in either
position the cards' meanings are the same.</p>

<p>Suit values are as follows: Clubs lead and
mostly portend happiness and good business arrangements,
and no matter how numerous or how
accompanied by cards of other suits are seldom considered
as bearers of other than the very best augury.
Next comes hearts, which are usually taken
to signify love-making, invitations, and good
friends; diamonds, money; and spades, annoyances,
sickness or worry, sometimes loss of money.</p>


<h3><i>Clubs.</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="negidt">Ace&mdash;Great wealth, much prosperity, and tranquillity
of mind.</p>

<p class="negidt">King&mdash;A man who is humane, upright and affectionate;
faithful in all his undertakings. He will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
be happy himself, and make every one around
him so.</p>

<p class="negidt">Queen&mdash;A tender, mild and rather susceptible
woman, who will be very attractive to the opposite
sex.</p>

<p class="negidt">Jack&mdash;An open, sincere and good friend, who will
exert himself warmly in your welfare.</p>

<p class="negidt">Ten&mdash;Speedy wealth.</p>

<p class="negidt">Nine&mdash;Obstinacy and disagreeables connected
therewith.</p>

<p class="negidt">Eight&mdash;A covetous person, extremely fond of
money; that he will obtain it but not make a
proper use of it.</p>

<p class="negidt">Seven&mdash;The most brilliant fortune and the most
exquisite bliss this world can afford, but beware
of the opposite sex, from these alone can misfortune
be experienced.</p>

<p class="negidt">Six&mdash;A lucrative partnership.</p>

<p class="negidt">Five&mdash;Marriage to a person who will improve
your circumstances.</p>

<p class="negidt">Four&mdash;Inconstancy and change.</p>

<p class="negidt">Trey&mdash;Three wealthy marriages.</p>

<p class="negidt">Deuce&mdash;Opposition or disappointment.</p></div>


<h3><i>Diamonds.</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="negidt">Ace&mdash;A letter.</p>

<p class="negidt">King&mdash;A man of fiery temper, continued anger,
seeking revenge, and obstinate in his resolutions.</p>

<p class="negidt">Queen&mdash;A coquette, and fond of company.</p>

<p class="negidt">Jack&mdash;However nearly related, will look more to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
his own interest than yours, will be tenacious in
his own opinions, and fly off if contradicted.</p>

<p class="negidt">Ten&mdash;A country husband (or wife), with wealth,
and many children; also a purse of gold.</p>

<p class="negidt">Nine&mdash;A surprise about money.</p>

<p class="negidt">Eight&mdash;Unhappy marriage late in life.</p>

<p class="negidt">Seven&mdash;Waste of goods, and losses.</p>

<p class="negidt">Six&mdash;An early marriage and widowhood, but a
second marriage would probably be worse.</p>

<p class="negidt">Five&mdash;Success in enterprises; if married, good
children.</p>

<p class="negidt">Four&mdash;Vexation and annoyance.</p>

<p class="negidt">Trey&mdash;Quarrels, lawsuits, and domestic disagreements,
your partner for life will be a vixen, bad
tempered, and make you unhappy.</p>

<p class="negidt">Deuce&mdash;Your heart will be engaged in love at an
early period, but you will meet with great opposition.</p></div>


<h3><i>Hearts.</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="negidt">Ace&mdash;Feasting and pleasure, and is also the house.
If attended with spades it is quarreling; if by
hearts, friendship and affection; if by diamonds,
you will hear of an absent friend; if by clubs,
merry-making and rejoicing.</p>

<p class="negidt">King&mdash;A man of good natured disposition, hot and
hasty, rash in his undertakings, and very amorous.</p>

<p class="negidt">Queen&mdash;A woman of fair complexion, faithful and
affectionate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p class="negidt">Jack&mdash;A person of no particular sex, but always
the dearest friend or nearest relation of the consulting
party. It is said that you must pay
great attention to the cards that stand next to
the jack, as from them alone you are supposed to
judge whether the person it represents will be
favorable to your inclinations or not.</p>

<p class="negidt">Ten&mdash;A good heart, it is supposed to correct the
bad tidings of the cards that stand next it; if
its neighboring cards are of good report, it is
supposed to confirm their value.</p>

<p class="negidt">Nine&mdash;Wealth, grandeur, and high esteem; if cards
that are unfavorable stand near it, disappointments
and the reverse. If favorable cards follow
these last at a small distance, you will retrieve
your losses, whether of peace or goods.</p>

<p class="negidt">Eight&mdash;Drinking and feasting.</p>

<p class="negidt">Seven&mdash;A fickle and unfaithful person.</p>

<p class="negidt">Six&mdash;A generous, open and credulous disposition,

<h3>METHOD A.</h3>

<p class="center">Using 52 Cards and the Foregoing Interpretations.</p>


<p>Take a pack of fifty-two cards and shuffle them
three times well over, and making the significator
whichever queen you please (if a lady performs the
operation for herself; or king, if a gentleman), then
proceed to lay them on the table, nine in a row, and
wherever the operator finds himself placed, count
nine cards every way, not forgetting the said significator,
then it will be seen what card the significator
comes in company with, and read from that.</p>

<p>When several diamonds come together, the interpretation
is that some money will soon be received;
several hearts, love; several clubs, drink and noisy
troublesome company; several spades, trouble and
vexation.</p>

<p>If two red tens come next to the significator marriage
or prosperity, the ace of hearts is the house,
the ace of clubs a letter, the ace of spades death,
spite, or quarreling (for this is supposed to be the
worst card in the pack), the ten of diamonds a
journey, the three of hearts a salute, the three of
spades tears, the ten of spades sickness, the nine
of spades sad disappointment or trouble, to the
nine of clubs is ascribed a jovial entertainment or
reveling, the nine of hearts feasting, the ten of clubs
traveling by water, the ten of hearts some place of
amusement, the five of hearts a present, the five of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
clubs a bundle, the six of spades a child, the seven
of spades a removal, the three of clubs fighting, the
eight of clubs confusion, the eight of spades a roadway,
the four of clubs a strange bed, the nine of diamonds
business, the five of spades a surprise, the
two red eights new clothes, the three of diamonds
speaking with a friend, the four of spades a sick
bed, the seven of clubs a prison, the two of spades
a false friend, the four of hearts the marriage bed.</p>

<p>If a married lady doth lay the cards, she must
then make her husband the king of the same suit she
is queen of; but if a single lady, she must make her
lover what king she may think proper. The jacks
of the same suits are supposed to be men's thoughts,
so that they may know what they are thinking of,
counting nine cards from where they are placed, and
it is said if any lady should wish to know whether
she shall obtain her desires in any particular subject,
matter, or thing whatsoever, let her shuffle the
cards well, most seriously and earnestly wishing all
the time for one thing; she must then cut them
once, particularly observing at the same time what
card that is which she cuts, then shuffle them and
deal them out in three parcels, and if that said particular
card which she has cut doth come next herself,
or next the ace of hearts, it is taken that she
will have her wish, but if the nine of spades is next
to her she judges the contrary, as that is supposed
to be a disappointment; however, she may try it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
three times, taking the major number of testimonies
as a ground whereon to place her judgment. This
method of using the cards is both innocent and will
afford amusement.</p>

<h2><a name="MODERN_USE_OF_52_CARDS" id="MODERN_USE_OF_52_CARDS"></a>MODERN USE OF 52 CARDS</h2>


<p>Here we present the more modern adaptation of
the entire pack of 52 cards to the fortune-teller's
use. As the meanings differ materially from the
ancient list just given, another complete list and
several combinations are presented.</p>

<p>In the modern usage, Diamonds take precedence
and are considered to mean money, riches and success.</p>

<p>Hearts next, love affairs, friendship, amusement
and pleasure.</p>

<p>Clubs, business matters, whether investments, appointments
or settlements.</p>

<p>Spades, losses or grief, trouble and anxiety, sometimes
sickness and death.</p>

<p>The various combinations are supposed to either
accelerate or mitigate the several meanings.</p>

<p>For instance&mdash;the ace of diamonds coming with
the ace of spades, a railway journey&mdash;the nine of
spades, usually taken to be a bad card, but coming
with diamonds, speedy good luck, etc.</p>

<h3><a name="METHOD_B" id="METHOD_B"></a>METHOD B.</h3>


<p>A pack of fifty-two cards is taken, shuffled, and
cut in three; the first ten are taken out, then three
are missed; another nine are taken out, then two are
missed; another seven out, five missed; seven out,
three missed; three out, one missed; and the last of
the pack is taken. They are now laid out in rows
of eight each, eight having been counted every way,
beginning from the significator. When all are finished,
the two extremities are taken, paired and
read; they are then gathered together, shuffled, and
cut in four parcels; the first one of each parcel is
taken off and put on one side. The packet that
comes first is the one that should be read.</p>



<h3><a name="METHOD_C" id="METHOD_C"></a>METHOD C.</h3>

<p class="center">What is Supposed to Happen Within a Month to
Two Months.</p>


<p>A pack of fifty-two cards is taken, shuffled and
cut in three, each meaning being read as it turns up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
The cards are then turned up one by one till a spade
is found, which is not withdrawn, but the following
card, which lay face uppermost on the table. If
three spades are found in succession the first is
missed, but the two next are taken out, as well as
the following card, whether diamonds, clubs or
hearts; this is continued to the end of the pack, then
re-commenced without shuffling or cutting. Should
the final card have been a spade, on beginning the
pack afresh the first card should be taken out. The
same operation is gone through twice more, in all
three times. This having been done, they are laid
in the form of a horseshoe in front of the dealer in
the order in which they came, being careful to note
that the significator is amongst them. Should it
not appear naturally, it must be taken out and
placed at the end. Seven are now counted from the
one that represents the person consulting the oracle.
When they have been read, and the relative meanings
ascribed to them explained, one is taken from
each end and paired, their various significations
being interpreted as they turn up. These prognostications
are supposed to come to pass within two
months. A shorter way can be done by taking out
thirty-two selected cards, viz:&mdash;ace, king, queen,
jack, ten, nine, eight and seven of each suit; they
are read in precisely the same way. This is taken
to allow a shorter period to elapse, from ten days to
a fortnight, but the former is supposed to be the
better method.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>




<h3>METHOD D.</h3>


<p>A pack of fifty-two cards is taken, and after
being well shuffled they are turned up one by one,
counting one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, jack, queen, king (here the ace counts as
one). If any card should fall on the number
counted&mdash;thus, supposing a five comes when five
is counted, or a king when that card turns up, it
must be taken out and placed on the table, face uppermost,
before the dealer. After counting to a
king the counting is re-commenced at one. Should
two cards follow, such as three and four, eight and
nine, etc., these must be abstracted, also three of a
kind, such as three tens, three kings, etc., they must
also be taken out; but if three of the same suit they
may be passed by. When the pack has been carefully
gone through, shuffled and cut, the process is
gone through twice more, in all three times. They
are now all laid out in rows of four and read. When
this is done they are gathered together and laid two
by two, thus:&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'></td><td align='left'>NORTH.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>WEST.</td><td></td><td align='left'>EAST.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'></td><td align='left'>SOUTH.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noidt">One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,
and so on till the pack is exhausted. Those at
the top are the North, those at the bottom are the
South, those at the right hand the East, those at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the left hand the West. The North is to be read
first, as that is supposed to happen first; the South
next, the East next, and the West last.</p>




<h3><a name="METHOD_E" id="METHOD_E"></a>METHOD E.</h3>


<p>The pack of fifty-two cards is taken, shuffled, and
cut in three, the meanings of the cut being read
first. Then the significator is taken out. The
cards are spread on the table, face downwards before
the dealer, and seven are drawn out at random.
The topmost card of the seven is taken off and put
on one side. The cards are again shuffled and cut
in three, the cut again read as before; they are laid
on the table, seven cards being taken off, the topmost
being withdrawn. This is to be repeated the
third time, still taking off the topmost card. The
cards are again shuffled and cut, this time nine each
time being drawn out and the topmost two removed.
This maneuver has to be repeated three times, each
time taking two of the topmost cards. In the first
deal, where the first seven cards were removed, there
will be eighteen cards; the second time there will be
twenty-one remaining after having removed the two
of each cut, thus:&mdash;The thirty-nine cards are
spread out in five rows of seven, and four remaining
underneath. The significator is now put in the center,
and counting every way from it, these cards are
taken to signify the past and present. The nine
cards that have been taken from each sevens and
nines are to be shuffled and looked at. These are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
supposed to refer entirely to the future. The three
cards that are left out are useless.</p>




<h3><a name="METHOD_F_THE_STAR" id="METHOD_F_THE_STAR"></a>METHOD F&mdash;THE STAR.</h3>


<p>The pack of fifty-two cards is taken, shuffled, and
cut in three, the cut being explained as it is shown.
The card representing the significator should be
taken out and put in the middle. Three cards are
now placed above the head, three at the feet, three
to the left, and three to the right, three at the four
corners, and three across the significator. They
are interpreted as follows:&mdash;First, above the head,
then at the feet, then to the right hand, and next to
the left; each corner to be taken top and bottom
opposite. When these are all explained (those
across the significator last), they are then paired,
beginning with the topmost cards and the bottom
cards, from end to end.</p>




<h3><a name="METHOD_G_A_SHORTER_STAR" id="METHOD_G_A_SHORTER_STAR"></a>METHOD  G&mdash;A SHORTER STAR.</h3>


<p>This is a much shorter way, and instead of placing
the cards as they come, they must be first well shuffled
by the person consulting, then laid face downwards
on the table and nine cards withdrawn (the
significator must be in the center). In this method
the cards are placed round the card representing
the consultor in the order in which they come, the
first card drawn being put at the head of the significator,
and the others in rotation. The nine cards
are first explained as they lie, eight round and one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
over the significator. Then the consultor is desired
to again draw nine, and these are put over the first
nine; this is to be repeated a third time, combining
all the cards as they lay one over the other, three
deep, every way.</p>




<h3><a name="METHOD_H" id="METHOD_H"></a>METHOD H.</h3>


<p>The whole pack is taken, shuffled well, but not
cut, every fifth card is picked out and laid by, the
pack is gone through and every seventh card picked
out, every third card must be taken, each fifth,
seventh and third cards to be laid aside in separate
packets; then each packet is carefully examined,
whether the significator is amongst those withdrawn.
If not, he or she must be abstracted and placed at
the extreme end. Now the third pack is laid out in
a row, the second next, and the first last, and all that
is hidden is said to be shown you, counting three,
seven and five from each row, beginning with the
significator. Now two are taken from end to end
and read till twelve are obtained; they are put on
one side; then the rest are gone on with from end
to end until all are exhausted. Then they are all
taken up, including the twelve that were put aside,
shuffled, the two first and last are taken off. These
three form "the surprise"; then parcels of four
are dealt, beginning with the first; they are all read
in rotation and the small "surprise" last.</p>




<h3><a name="METHOD_I" id="METHOD_I"></a>METHOD I.</h3>


<p>The pack of fifty-two cards is taken, shuffled, cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
in three, and the meanings ascribed to the cut are
explained. Then they are laid in rows of five till
the whole pack is exhausted, except the two last,
which are useless. The first row is to represent
"the person for whom you are acting"; the second,
"the house"; the third, "your wish"; the fourth,
"the surprise," and the fifth, "what is supposed to
come true." The first ten are now read <i>lengthwise</i>,
the others in the same manner till the fifth row has
been explained; then they are taken from end to
end, each pair being interpreted as arrived at. In
this case there is no significator, as the first row is
supposed to stand for what will happen immediately
to the consultant. They are all gathered together,
shuffled and cut, and laid in packets of three. The
consultor is desired to choose one of the three parcels,
and that is laid out first and explained; then
follow each of the other two, which must be also
read in the same manner.</p>




<h3><a name="METHOD_J" id="METHOD_J"></a>METHOD J.</h3>


<p>The pack of fifty-two cards is taken, shuffled and
cut by the person consulting. They are cut in three
and the meanings interpreted. Then they are laid
out in rows of sevens, leaving the three last, which
are not to be used. Then nine are counted every
way, from the significator backwards and forwards,
from left to right, and from right to left, up and
down, always returning to the significator, then
crossways from end to end. Then they are paired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
from corner to corner, each card being explained as
it is arrived at, noticing if there should be any pairs,
triplets, etc., amongst them. Then they are gathered
up and shuffled well, then they are dealt in two
packets, the consultant being desired to choose one.
The one taken is supposed to represent the past and
present, the other the future. They are laid out
and read pretty much as before.</p>




<h3><a name="METHOD_K" id="METHOD_K"></a>METHOD K.</h3>


<p>A pack of fifty-two cards is taken, shuffled and
cut, and divided thus:&mdash;Every seven, nine and five
are to be removed and put on one side. The six of
clubs, the eight and ten of diamonds are to be withdrawn
and put in a place by themselves. Then the
rest are shuffled and five cards laid out face upwards
till the pack is exhausted. It will now be found
there are seven rows of five cards each, and two remaining;
these two are placed with the nines, sevens
and fives, to be used later. These cards are read,
counting seven every way from the significator, then
gathered together, shuffled and cut, the first group
(seven in number) being first of all withdrawn,
which must be added to the nines, sevens and fives
already withdrawn. There will now be four groups
of seven cards each. The first must be read, the
second put aside, the third explained, and the fourth
laid by. The second and fourth are left out entirely
and not used. The nines, sevens and fives
and the first group you have withdrawn are shuffled,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
cut in two packets, and laid out on the table before
the dealer. If two red nines appear close together,
it is taken to show honor, dignity and joy; if two
red sevens and two red fives side by side, great and
unexpected good luck, a legacy or money that you
don't anticipate; if two red fives and the nine of
hearts are near each other, a marriage of affection;
if with the seven of diamonds, a moneyed marriage,
but of love; if two red fives and two black sevens, a
marriage for money which will turn out unhappily;
if two red sevens and two red fives, and the nine of
hearts appear, it is supposed to be the greatest and
happiest prognostic you can have, whether married
or single&mdash;luck, pleasure, money; if two black
sevens and two black fives appear, it is considered
very evil, and if accompanied by the nine of spades,
unhappiness in marriage, divorce, scandal and sometimes
violence caused through drink; if the eight of
spades should be amongst those withdrawn and turn
up with the aforesaid cards, violent death by murder
or accident. It is taken to be the worst combination
in the pack. These cards (viz: the nines,
sevens and fives, and those which have been withdrawn
from the group of fives) are laid in rows of
sevens, counting seven every way from the significator;
then the extreme ends are taken and paired,
being read as they turn up. Next the whole is shuffled,
including the six of clubs and the eight and ten
of diamonds. These three cards are the index.
Wherever they appear they are supposed to show<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
good luck, happiness and prosperity; if they should
happen between exceptionally bad cards, the luck is
over, or marred through malignity; but as a rule
they are taken to import great joy. The evil combination
is thus: If the six of clubs is surrounded
with spades, or the eight or ten of diamonds are
<i>between</i> two black fives and the two black sevens are
near, then the best laid scheme will come to nought;
but if they are surrounded by the nine of hearts and
nine of diamonds, then it is a very good omen. The
eight and ten of diamonds are supposed to be extremely
good if there are three or four nines to follow
them, for then the nine of spades loses its evil
significance, and should the seven of diamonds and
seven of hearts follow, a good marriage and happiness;
or, if the person is married, new prosperity or
riches for the husband or sometimes the birth of an
heir.</p>



<h3><a name="METHOD_L" id="METHOD_L"></a>METHOD L.</h3>


<p>The pack of fifty-two cards is taken, shuffled and
cut, and divided into two equal heaps. One of
these is chosen by the consultant. Having decided
this, the other heap is left alone; it is not to be used.
The person consulting is now desired to shuffle the
twenty-six cards remaining, cutting in three, the
meanings being read as they turn up. They are
now dealt in three packs, which are laid out in rows
of eight, the last card to be left out, as that forms
"the surprise." Four cards are now counted from
the significator, which, should it not be in the pack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
chosen, must be abstracted and put at the end.
When these have been fully explained, the same
maneuver is repeated twice, in all three times, one
card being always taken out for "the surprise."
"The surprise" is turned up when those cards before
the dealer have been examined and explained.
Then they are all gathered together, and, after being
shuffled and cut, they are turned up by fours. If a
sequence should come up, such as six and seven, or
six, seven and eight of any suit, they are taken out.
If four of a suit, the lowest is taken out. This is
only to be done once. These are now laid out in a
row before the dealer and read from left to right,
always taking note that the significator is amongst
them, and counting four as above described. Then
the two cards are taken from each extremity and
each couple explained till all are exhausted.</p>




<h3><a name="METHOD_M" id="METHOD_M"></a>METHOD M.</h3>


<p>A pack of fifty-two cards is taken, shuffled well
and cut. Then it is divided into three equal parcels
of seventeen cards each, and one over for "the surprise,"
which is to be laid aside. The first three
cards of each packet is taken, and each three is put
apart. That will leave fourteen in each group.
The first and third packets of fourteen are taken up,
the middle one being put aside. These are now laid
out in four rows of seven, being sure that the significator
is amongst them; or else the card which is supposed
to represent the thoughts of the person con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>sulting
you, viz: the jack, may be counted from.
Six are now counted, beginning from the next card
to the significator; and after every sixth card, that
card is not counted as one, but the following one.
When these have been explained, which must be done
till the significator is returned to, they are paired
from end to end, and read as arrived at; then they
are gathered together, shuffled and cut, and divided
again into two groups of fourteen. These are not
laid out again, but two being merely extracted from
each of these, not forgetting the middle one, and
adding them to the three packets of three placed on
one side. The middle one is now taken up, shuffled
well, and four cards taken from it, two from the top
and two from the bottom, and added to the one put
aside to form "the surprise." There are now four
packs of five cards each:&mdash;One for the "consultant"
and one for the "house," one for "what is
sure to come true," and one for "the surprise."
These are laid out in front of the dealer and read
from left to right in rotation.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PREFERRED_ORACLE_WITH" id="THE_PREFERRED_ORACLE_WITH"></a>THE PREFERRED ORACLE&mdash;WITH
32 CARDS</h2>


<p>We now come to the most important and approved
method of telling fortunes by cards, the
method preferred and practiced in nearly all countries.
This widely accepted method requires but 32
cards of the 52 found in the pack, consisting of
eight cards of each suit, as follows: Ace, king,
queen, jack, ten, nine, eight and seven only. To
these may be added, in some cases, the Consultant
card, concerning which we have spoken earlier in
this work.</p>

<p>To enable this oracle to be read with an intelligent
and proper understanding it is important that one
be fully informed as to all the possible values or interpretations
of the cards, singly and in combination.
Hence we shall devote a number of pages to
these definitions in very complete form before proceeding
to elucidate for you the various methods of
dealing, laying and reading the cards. We give first
the simple and primary meanings, followed in detail
by their secondary or synonymical meanings, the
whole constituting a valuable work of reference for
all who practice the art, enabling them to give a full,
fair and wise reading of every possible "fall" of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the cards. The primary meanings, while sufficient
for the amateur, will soon be seen by the student to
be lacking in that completeness and flexibility demanded
by the adept. Their natural amplification
into their secondary and more extended definitions
gives the interpreter the fullest scope to exercise his
powers of reading any possible layout of the cards
intelligently, and with satisfaction both to himself
and to the person consulting the oracle.</p>

<h3>THE CONSULTANT.</h3>

<p>When coming out in an upright position, in the
body of the deal designates merely the person consulting
the oracle, in a natural state of mind.</p>

<p>When the card comes out in the deal reversed, it
denotes the consultant to be in a disturbed state
of mind, or annoyed from some cause beyond his
or her control. Coming with the <i>eight of spades
reversed</i>, for example, by its side, it shows that the
consultant's mind has been disordered through
prospects of ambition or religious excitement. If
accompanied by the <i>eight of hearts</i>, it demonstrates
that he or she is annoyed through being a victim to
the tender passion.</p>

<h2><a name="DICTIONARY_OF_SECONDARY" id="DICTIONARY_OF_SECONDARY"></a>DICTIONARY OF SECONDARY
DEFINITIONS</h2>

<p class="center"><i>And Synonyms, Supplementing the Preceding List</i>.

<i>Consult Both</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">King of Diamonds</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  This card,
when used as a representative, denotes a very fair
man, one with auburn hair, light blue eyes, and
florid complexion, who, notwithstanding his hasty
temper, will treasure his anger, long awaiting opportunities
for revenge, or he is obstinate in his
resolutions.</p>

<p>It moreover designates a military officer, and
frequently one of fidelity to his country and its
honor.</p>

<p>Still, it is most generally employed as the marriage
card, for if it does not come out in an oracle
wherein matrimony is the wish, the nuptials will be
delayed or broken off.</p>

<p>Its synonymical signification would then be:</p>

<p>Alliance; reunion; attachment; vow; oath; intimacy;
assemblage; junction; union; chain; peace;
accord; harmony; good understanding; reconciliation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King of Diamonds</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card sig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>nifies
a country gentleman, in which capacity its
synonyms are:</p>

<p>Country man; rustic; villager; peasant; farm
laborer; cultivator; rural; agriculture.</p>

<p>Again, this card reversed, bears a further signification
of a good and severe man, when its synonyms
would be:</p>

<p>Indulgent severity; indulgence; compliance; condescension;
complacency; tolerance; low descension.</p>

<p>When used as the marriage card, and coming out
reversed, the king of diamonds signifies primarily
difficulties and obstacles imposed in the way of entering
upon or consummating the nuptial contract,
and through inference vitiation of the married state,
when its synonyms are:</p>

<p>Slavery; captivity; servitude; matrimonial ruptures;
conjugal infidelity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen of Diamonds</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  When this
card comes out in the oracle upright it bears three
primary significations: <i>a country lady</i>; <i>a talkative</i>
or <i>communicative female</i>; and a <i>good, kind-hearted
woman</i>.</p>

<p>As a representative card it designates a very
fair female with auburn or blonde hair, brilliantly
clear complexion and very blue eyes. A woman of
this character will be given to society, and is naturally
a coquette.</p>

<p>When the card is taken as a <i>country lady</i> its
synonyms will be through induction or inference:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Economical housewife; chaste and honest woman;
honesty; civility; politeness; sweetness of temper;
virtue; honor; chastity; a model wife; excellent
mother.</p>

<p>When used to designate a <i>talkative female</i>, they
will be:</p>

<p>Conversation; discourse; deliberation; dissertation;
discussion; conference; intellectual entertainment;
prattler; blab; idle talk; flippant conversation;
table talk; gossip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen of Diamonds</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  When the
card comes out reversed in the oracle its ordinary
signification is that of a meddlesome woman, who
has interfered in the affairs of the consultant for
the purpose of doing him or her injury, and the extent
of the injury, contemplated or done, can be
estimated from the proximity of this card to that
of the consultant, or from the import of those cards
intervening between the two. This card has two
secondary significations as follows:</p>

<p><i>Want of foresight</i>, whose synonyms are:</p>

<p>Unawares; unexpectedly; on a sudden; napping;
astonished; suddenly; fortuitously; unhoped for;
surprisingly.</p>

<p><i>A knavish trick</i>, whose synonyms would be:</p>

<p>Roguishness; knavery; cheat; imposture; deceit;
sharpness in rascality; trickery; false pretense;
artifice; wile; craftiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack of Diamonds</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  The primary
signification of this card is a <i>soldier</i>, a <i>postillion</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
or a light haired <i>young man, in or from the
country</i>. In addition to these characteristics this
card, whether upright or reversed, assumes another,
which is technically called <i>the good stranger</i>.</p>

<p>As a <i>soldier</i>, its secondary value is expressed in
the following synonyms:</p>

<p>Man at arms; swordsman; fencing master; combatant;
enemy; duel; war; battle; attack; defense;
opposition; resistance; ruin; overthrow; hostility;
hatred; wrath; resentment; courage; valor; bravery;
satellite; stipendiary.</p>

<p>In the quality of <i>the good stranger</i>, its synonyms
are:</p>

<p>Strange; unaccustomed; unknown; unheard of;
unusual; unwonted; surprising; admirable; marvelous;
prodigious; miracle; episode; digression;
anonymous.</p>

<p>When employed as a representative of a person,
it denotes a light haired, unmarried man, who, although
one of your nearest relations, will sacrifice
your interests to his own; a person of stubbornness;
hot headed and hasty, tenacious of his own
opinions and unable to brook contradiction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack of Diamonds</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card's
signification is a public or private servant; and in
the latter case, without reference to gender, either
a male or female domestic. Its synonyms therefore
are in accordance with its acceptation:</p>

<p>Servant; waiter; valet; chambermaid; lady's
maid; a subordinate; an inferior; a hireling; con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>dition

<p><span class="smcap">Ace of Diamonds</span>&mdash;It is a matter of perfect
indifference whether this card assumes its place in
the oracle in an upright or reversed position, as its
primary signification is in no wise varied, although
of a most comprehensive nature, being, expressing
generally, a <i>letter</i>, a <i>note</i>, a <i>paper</i>, a <i>petition</i>, etc.</p>

<p>It requires, however, a great deal of attention to
discriminate between the manifold significations of
this all-important card, which is governed in a great
measure by the cards coming next to it, otherwise
the interpreter may be entirely baffled in comprehending
the intent of the oracle.</p>

<p>The general synonyms of the <i>ace of diamonds</i>
are:</p>

<p>Epistle; writings; the art of writing; grammar;
Holy Writ; text; literature; doctrine; erudition;
literary labor; book; correspondence; composition;
alphabet; elements of all learning; principles;
bonds; bills of exchange; notes of hand; evidence
of indebtedness.</p>

<p>With the <i>seven of spades, reversed</i>, coming next
to it, this card denotes the existence of a law suit,
in which case we have synonyms, founded on the
following basis:</p>

<p>Deed; covenant; agreement; law paper; writs;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
warrants; litigation; differences; contestations;
disputes; discussions; bickering; contest; strife;
discord; contradiction; stratagem; trick; broil;
pettifogging; wrangling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten of Diamonds</span>&mdash;Like its companion, the
<i>ace</i>, which with this card form the only two in the
pack possessing this peculiar quality, the <i>ten of
diamonds</i> preserves its value and signification,
whether it emerges either upright or reversed. The
primary significations of this card are <i>gold</i>, <i>water</i>,
the <i>sea</i>, a <i>foreign city</i>, <i>change of locality</i>.</p>

<p>As the representative of <i>gold</i> its synonyms are:</p>

<p>Riches; opulence; magnificence; splendor; &eacute;clat;
sumptuousness; luxury; abundance; means.</p>

<p>When its signification is assumed relative to
<i>water</i> and the <i>sea</i>, the synonyms assume both a
specific and general nature:</p>

<p>Fluid; humid; ablution; dew; rain; deluge; inundation;
the ocean; river; torrent; stream; fountain;
source; lake; pond; cascade; falls.</p>

<p>When the surrounding cards designate this one
to be accepted as representing a foreign city, its
synonyms are:</p>

<p>Traveler; traveling; foreign parts; beyond the
sea; homeless; wanderer; wandering abroad; trading;
commerce; a sailor; ships; refuge; exile.</p>

<p>When accepted to signify a <i>change in locality</i>,
the synonyms, in addition to preservation of its
original meaning of a mere change in domicile, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
habitation, are inferentially extended to embrace a
wider scope, such as:</p>

<p>Departure; displacement; journey; pilgrimage;
peregrination; steps; motion; visits; excursions;
incursions; emigration; immigration; transmigration;
flight; tour; rotation; circulation; deportation;
rout; defeat; overthrow; bewilderment; disconcert;
to break one's allegiance; desertion; disinheritance;
alienation; alien; a foreigner; houseless.</p>

<p>It will be seen that with the varied significations
which can be given to this card, it is one of the most
important in the pack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nine of Diamonds</span>&mdash;<i>Upright.</i> &nbsp;  When coming
forth in its natural position, this card is one of
particular good omen, as it foretells great success
in business operations and consequent gain. Its
primary meaning comprehends the grand mainspring
to human exertion, <i>enterprise</i>, while at the
same time it assures you of the desired result, <i>advantage</i>
or <i>gain</i>. Viewed as such its synonyms are,
as to <i>enterprise</i> in the first instance:</p>

<p>To undertake; to commence; to usurp; to take
possession of; audacity; boldness; hardihood; impudence;
rashness; speculative; speculation; fearless
in trade; in love.</p>

<p>When taken to represent <i>advantage</i>, the synonyms
are:</p>

<p>Gain; profit; lucre; success; thanks; favor; bene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>fit;
ascendency; power; empire; authority; government;
rule; glory; reputation; happy results;
profitable end; victory; cure; fulfillment; termination;
satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nine of Diamonds</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed.</i> &nbsp;  We have the
other side of the picture, for this card, coming up
reversed portends the occurrence of dire mishaps
and abject despoliation with its concomitant poverty.
In view of this immense difference in the
value and signification of this one and the same
card in its two positions, too much care cannot
be taken to mark the way in which it emerges.</p>

<p>In its modified signification of <i>delay</i>, its synonyms
are:</p>

<p>Disarranged; sent back; suspension; variation;
wavering; slowness; relenting; obstacle; impediment;
misfortune; adversity; accidental injuries;
miscarriage.</p>

<p>But viewed in its more bitter light as <i>spoliation</i>
and <i>poverty</i>, its synonyms are:</p>

<p>Destitution; violence; ruin; victim of robbery; a
fall; ruined honor; bankruptcy; privation; violated
chastity; defrauded; swindled; victimized;
separation; sold out by the sheriff; cast upon the
town; hopeless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eight of Diamonds</span>&mdash;<i>Upright.</i> &nbsp;  In its natural
position this card is accepted to represent either
<i>the country</i> or <i>riches</i>, as its signification is relatively
determined from its surroundings.</p>

<p>In its signification as the <i>country</i>, thereby mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>ing
not only a rural district but the characteristics
of a country existence, the interpretation
of this card boasts a large number of synonyms:</p>

<p>Agriculture; cultivation; field labor; farming;
garden; prairie; woods; shades; pleasure; enjoyment;
diversion; pastime; amusement; rejuvenation;
rural sports; rustic dances; peace; calmness;
natural tranquillity; rural life; forests; vales;
mountains; flocks and herds; shepherd; shepherdess;
moral quietude.</p>

<p>As the synonyms of <i>riches</i>, as they are signified
by this card in contradistinction to others, we
have:</p>

<p>Augmentation of wealth; increase of estate; advancement;
prosperity; general success; happiness;
goodness; felicity; beauty; embellishment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eight of Diamonds</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  In this condition
the primary signification of the card is <i>sorrow</i>
and <i>movement</i>. The synonyms for <i>sorrow</i>
are:</p>

<p>Sadness; affliction; displeasure; grief; desolation;
mortification; bad humor; melancholy; the
blues; hypochondria; vexation; trouble.</p>

<p>But with the word <i>movement</i>, we have more trouble
to apply its actual signification, as shown in
the cards, and therefore the interpreter is left in a
great degree to her own judgment, to decipher the
connection which should bind the oracle to a specific
and intelligent reading.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>The most applicable synonyms would therefore
be:</p>

<p>To walk; step forward; move about; to contemplate;
to propose; to make advances; to undertake;
to offer proposals; to promenade; to tender offers;
to inaugurate a scheme; to further any claims.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seven of Diamonds</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  This is what
is most commonly styled the <i>conversation</i> card, as
its initial and primary signification is <i>discourse for
the present</i>, while it likewise designates the approaching
receipt of <i>good news</i>; as the oracle demands,
to be secure, proper interpretation.</p>

<p>When used as the <i>conversation</i> card, its synonyms
are:</p>

<p>Talk; words; matter; tattle; desultory remarks;
seasonable language; pleasant gossip; table talk;
anecdote.</p>

<p>Secondary to this signification, and in intimate
connection, it has oftentimes been employed to denote
<i>designs for the moment</i>, whether mental or expressed
by word of mouth, embracing intent and
resolution.</p>

<p>When signifying <i>news</i>, the synonyms will be:</p>

<p>Announcement; intelligence; newspaper; advice;
advertisement; admonition; warning; teaching; tale
telling; history; fables; anecdotal remarks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seven of Diamonds</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card is
capable, when emerging reversed, of receiving several
interpretations, the general and primary one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
of which is <i>birth</i>, or the origin of a human being, or
of matter which has, as its synonyms:</p>

<p>Nativity; origin; creation; source; commencement;
principle; primitive; extraction; first coming
in of fruits and flowers; prime; early; race;
family; house; lineage; posterity; the reason for;
cause; premises for argument.</p>

<p>This card frequently designates a <i>great deal</i>,
or a large quantity, qualifying the value of those
cards next to it. For example, should it come before
the <i>ten of spades reversed</i>, or the <i>ten of clubs</i>,
it will read a great deal of jealousy, or of money.</p>

<p>Commingled with cards, relating to a public or
military official, this one is taken to signify <i>declaration</i>,
whose synonyms would consequently be:</p>

<p>Publication; orders; authenticity; approbation;
placard; designation; discovery; disclosure; revelation;
confession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  The primary significations
of this card are <i>a blonde man</i>, <i>an advocate</i>
and a <i>man of note</i>, but its secondary significations
are those attached to the state and <i>legislation</i>.</p>

<p>As the representative of an individual, this card
shows a good, kind-hearted man, of an amorous disposition,
rash in his enterprises, and generally hasty
and passionate in all his actions.</p>

<p>Coming out as a <i>blonde man</i>, it has these synonyms:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Honest man; honesty; probity; equity; arts and
sciences.</p>

<p>Considered as a <i>man of note</i> or statesman, the
synonyms are:</p>

<p>Legislation; legislator; laws; decrees; code; statutes;
precepts; commandments; combination; institution;
constitution; temperament; complexion;
natural and moral law; religious law; civil law;
politics; politician; natural right; right of nations;
public rights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card coming
out reversed, designates a man of natural light
complexion, neither fair nor brown, with dark brown
hair and hazel eyes, of an excellent temper, easily
imposed upon, credulous, moderately given to love
matters, yet addicted to vice and incontinence. Its
other primary significations are a <i>tutor</i>, or a <i>man
in anger</i>, possessing vices, the reverse of those good
qualities attributed to the card when upright. In
this case the synonyms are:</p>

<p>Indignation; agitation; irritation; wrath; rage;
fury; frenzy; violence; hatred; aversion; animosity;
peril; animadversion; antipathy; resentment;
vengeance; affront; outrage; blasphemy; storm;
tempest; cruelty; inhumanity; atrocity.</p>

<p>The chief secondary signification of this is a <i>man
in office</i>, or professional politician, to which are
given the following synonyms:</p>

<p>Man of rank; dishonest man; exaction; pillage;
injustice; simony; a dishonorable person; a burglar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  This card represents
a blonde female, faithful and affectionate,
always the dearest friend or nearest relative to the
consultant. As such, the synonyms, attached to
the primary signification, are of an excellent nature:</p>

<p>Honest woman; virtue; wisdom; honesty.</p>

<p>This card is likewise taken as symbolical of
<i>friendship</i> in its various phases, the synonyms of
the term being:</p>

<p>Attachment; affection; tenderness; benevolence;
kindly relations; fraternity; intimacy; identity in
inclinations; agreement; affinity; harmonious correspondence;
conformity; sympathy; attraction;
cohesion.</p>

<p>Another signification is attached to this card in
a secondary capacity as <i>justice</i>, with the following
synonyms:</p>

<p>Equity; probity; right; rectitude; reason; the
law.</p>

<p>A further secondary signification has been bestowed
upon this card, under certain influences,
when it is gifted with the attributes of <i>temperance</i>
with these synonyms:</p>

<p>Moderation; discretion; continence; abstinence;
patience; calmness; sobriety; frugality; chastity;
alleviation; reconciliation; respect; conciliation;
mitigation; molification; consolation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card reversed,
designates a fair, but not light, woman, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
nut-brown hair and grayish eyes, who intervenes to
prevent marriage, and intermeddles in all the consultant's
affairs generally. It likewise represents
either the wife of a man in office, a woman of doubtful
character, or a courtesan, a betrayer of honor
and of affection. Under this aspect it receives a
secondary signification of <i>dissension</i>, to which are
given synonyms as follows:</p>

<p>Agitations; sedition; conspiracy; rebellion;
pride; vanity; seduction; outrage; presumption;
disputes; moral wrong; dishonorable proposals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  This card, as a
representative one, designates a blonde, unmarried
man, learned, good tempered and well favored by
fortune. Consequently, when it is drawn by a
young woman, and the marriage card comes near it,
it portends that she will be united to a person of
such a description, and that the union will prove
both happy and of long duration.</p>

<p>It likewise designates, primarily, a soldier or a
traveler, so that should it come up in your oracle
it is interpreted, in a secondary connection, in this
sense, and assures that you are on the point of undertaking
a journey. If bright cards surround it,
the journey will be a prosperous one, but should
the <i>eight of spades</i> be near it, it will result in illness,
and if the <i>ten of spades</i> be adjacent, it will
be accompanied with tears.</p>

<p>In this secondary capacity it has synonyms as
follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Road; highway; lane; pathway; a walk; a
course; career; promenade; messenger; ways and
means; expedient; enterprise; method.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  Should this card
come out in the oracle of an unmarried lady, reversed,
it instructs her that her lover or intended
husband is a person wooing her for selfish purposes,
who, although handsome and accomplished,
will make a bad match.</p>

<p>To a married woman, or widow, it is a warning
that some unscrupulous individual, under garb of
friendship, contemplates her injury, which will be
followed by almost immediate desertion, if near the
<i>ace of spades</i>.</p>

<p>Consequently, in a secondary capacity, it is taken
to mean <i>evil desires</i> or <i>longing</i>, when it has synonyms
of this character:</p>

<p>Attraction; passion; flattery; cajolery; adulation;
lechery; or declivity; precipice; fall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ace of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  The first and primary
signification of this card is <i>the house</i>, and as
such obtains a secondary capacity of a most extensive
nature, expressed in the following synonyms:</p>

<p>Household; home; house-keeping; economy; saving;
dwelling; domicile; habitation; manor; lodge;
lodging; hotel; palace; shop; store; barracks;
building; vessel; vase; archives; castle; cabin; cottage;
tent; pavilion; inn; hostelry; tavern; religious
house; monastery; convent; burial; long home;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
grave; stable; extraction; family; race; lineage;
posterity; ancestry; retreat; asylum.</p>

<p>This card likewise designates a <i>repast</i> or <i>feasting</i>,
when, secondarily, it assumes synonyms of
the following nature:</p>

<p>Table; festivity; merry making; nutrition;
guests; invitation; host; hilarity; good cheer;
abundance; joy; gayety; natural pleasure; domestics;
sports and pastimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ace of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  It primarily designates
<i>forced</i> or <i>constrained enjoyment</i>, but more
generally it should be taken for <i>new acquaintances</i>,
whence is derived a secondary significance of <i>fresh
news</i>, with these synonyms:</p>

<p>Indication; presentiment; new instructions; fresh
knowledge; enlightenment; index; augury; forewarning;
fore-knowledge; conjecture; oracle; prognostication;
prediction; prophecy; divination; second
sight; novelty.</p>

<p>Again this card, reversed, means a <i>disordered
household</i>, and from this comes the secondary idea
of <i>intestine quarrels</i>, with the following more prominent
synonyms:</p>

<p>Misunderstanding; regret; remorse; repentance;
internal agitation; irresolution; uncertainty; family
feuds; marriage trouble; domestic strife; dissensions.</p>

<p>At times this card represents <i>family vices</i>, or extravagance
in household expenditures, or any de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>scription
of crime or folly which renders home unhappy
and unendurable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  This card ordinarily
signifies the <i>city</i>, when its secondary capacities
are expressed in some one from among the
following synonyms:</p>

<p>Metropolis; native land; burgh; village; town;
locality; site; town-house; dwelling; habitation;
residence; municipality; city government; citizens.</p>

<p>It moreover is accepted to signify <i>envious people</i>,
as by that term the ancient inhabitants of the rural
districts were wont to designate, ironically, dwellers
in cities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card most
generally signifies <i>an inheritance</i>, when its synonyms
are:</p>

<p>Succession; legacy; donation; testamentary
gifts; dowry; dower; dowager; legitimacy; will;
patrimony; heir; transmission; to bequeath; to endow.</p>

<p>It is likewise used to signify <i>relatives</i> when its
secondary capacity is extended to the widest scope,
embracing:</p>

<p>Consanguinity; blood; family; ancestors; father;
mother; brother; sister; aunt; uncle; cousin, male
or female; Adam and Eve; race; lineage; alliance;
relationship; affinity; blood connection; love intrigues.</p>

<p>Another primary signification of this card is <i>sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>prise</i>,
generally of a bad origin, with these appropriate
synonyms:</p>

<p>Cheat; imposture; knavery; deceit; trickery;
mistake; oversight; misunderstanding; trouble;
vexation; annoyance; emotion; fright; fear; terror;
consternation; astonishment; admiration;
alarm; rapture; exhaustion; swooning; fainting; a
marvel; phenomenon; miracle; anything wonderful
or strange.</p>

<p>Among the ancient cartomancists, this card, with
the <i>nine of hearts</i>, was regarded as the most difficult
of interpretation of any in the pack, but
through careful study of the synonyms above given,
a true meaning is readily attained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nine of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  This card is generally
regarded as an augury of good fortune,
wealth, happiness and worldly advantage.</p>

<p>Its principal signification is <i>victory</i>, whence we
derive:</p>

<p>Success; good results; advantage; gain; pomp;
triumph; trophies; majesty; show; apparel; baggage;
luggage; equipage; attire; furniture; rich
goods and wares.</p>

<p>Its next principal one is <i>union</i> and <i>concord</i>, with
the several secondary significations, cognate to
them:</p>

<p>Moderation; discretion; continence; temperance;
patience; calmness; sobriety; frugality; chastity;
harmony; music; musical tastes; perfect happiness.</p>

<p>It moreover designates <i>labor</i> and <i>commerce</i>, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
which capacity its signification is expressed in the
synonyms:</p>

<p>Studious; application; work; toil; reflection; observation;
meditation; occupation; trade; employment;
merchant; clerk; trader; laborer; mercantile
pursuits.</p>

<p>Still another signification is <i>a present</i>, whence
we have:</p>

<p>Gift; generosity; benefit; gratification; service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nine of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card means
<i>ennui</i>, or weariness, with secondary attributes expressed
in these synonyms:</p>

<p>Displeasure; discontent; disgust; aversion; inquietude;
lack of spirit; listlessness; trivial sorrow;
affliction; uneasiness; complaining; want of energy.</p>

<p>It moreover is employed to signify <i>curiosity</i>,
whence we have the secondary signification of inquisitiveness;
a busybody; a marplot and intruder.</p>

<p>Then again an ordinary signification of this card
is <i>obstacle</i> or <i>hindrance</i> with the following synonyms:</p>

<p>Bar; embarrassment; opposition; barrier; contrariety;
inconvenience; trouble; difficulty; work;
abjection; indisposition; ailment; infirmity; distress;
hesitation; vacillation; perplexity; impediment;
stumbling-block.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eight of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  The primary
signification of this card is first, a blonde young
lady of great natural abilities, gentle manners,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
lively disposition and personal beauty, for whom
we have synonyms:</p>

<p>Honest girl; virtuous girl; modesty; maidenly
grace; bashfulness; timidity; retiring disposition;
fear of scandal; apprehension; mildness; suavity
of temper.</p>

<p>It moreover signifies <i>success in expectations</i>, in
those enterprises whereupon the consultant has set
his heart, with the secondary significations of:</p>

<p>Success; happy issue; fortunate termination;
victory; cure; recovery; accomplishment; end of
trouble; discontinuance, termination of pains, torment
or labor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eight of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  When this card
comes into the oracle in a reversed position, and is
used as the representative of an individual, it designates
an unmarried lady, of a light complexion,
with chestnut-brown hair, of a natural good disposition,
but spoiled by an assumption of superiority
over her companions. From this signification, we
have that of <i>arrogance</i>, and thence:</p>

<p>Noise; quarreling; dispute; disturbance; difference;
contestations; litigation; bickerings; arguments.</p>

<p>But the most general signification of this card
reversed is <i>great joy</i>, otherwise expressed in these
synonyms:</p>

<p>Perfect content; felicity; happiness; rapture;
enchantment; ecstasy; entire satisfaction; complete
joy; inexpressible pleasure; heavenly inspiration;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
exhilaration; enthusiasm; the music of the spheres;
celestial harmony.</p>

<p>Under other influences this card becomes modified
to the signification of the <i>means of satisfaction</i>,
such as:</p>

<p>Gayety; dancing; the opera; the theater; festival;
public rejoicings; family reunions; poetry; romance;
joyous visits; pleasant parties; excursions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seven of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  When this card
emerges in its natural position, its primary signification
is that of <i>thought</i>, an <i>arm</i>, or a <i>jewel</i>.</p>

<p>As thought, it has many secondary significations
prominent among them those expressed by the synonyms:</p>

<p>The soul; spirit; intelligence; an idea; memory;
imagination; conception; comprehension; extension
of ideas; designs; intentions; desires; will; resolution;
determination; premeditation; meditation; reflection;
opinion; sentiment; philosopher; philosophy;
wisdom.</p>

<p>This card is sometimes employed to signify <i>solitude</i>,
when it obtains a secondary signification:</p>

<p>A desert; seclusion; retreat from society; hermitage;
exile; banishment; isolation; abandonment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seven of Hearts</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  When this card
comes out reversed, one of its primary significations
is a <i>package</i>, or bundle, present, new clothes,
etc., in accordance with the signification of the cards
immediately preceding or following it, which can
be easily learned by study.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, its most ordinary signification is
<i>desire</i>, or a strong longing for, or hankering after,
some person or thing; but then again the interpretation
is qualified by the cards coming near this one,
either before or after; reading from the consultant
to the right, by a simple change in position of the
cards, <i>desire</i> may be changed into <i>aversion</i>, and an
<i>attraction</i> into <i>repulsion</i>.</p>

<p>When its signification is <i>desire</i>, its synonyms
will be:</p>

<p>Wish; now; will; coveting; cupidity; lusting
after; concupiscence; unlawful desire; extreme
hankering after; jealous; passion for good or bad;
illusion; craving; appetite; a fancy for a thing;
decided inclination.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the term <i>desire</i> is employed as
antagonistic to love, or a holy and righteous phase
of passion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  Employed as a
representative card, this one designates a man of
very dark complexion, with black eyes and hair,
passionate and proud, ambitious, and successful in
most of his aspirations, but a person whom the reverse
of fortune would utterly crush into obscurity.</p>

<p>Divested of this personal and destructive character,
this card, when coming upright in an oracle,
designates a professional man of eminence, a lawyer,
judge, advocate, counselor, senator, practitioner,
attorney, confidential agent, jurist, orator,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
statesman, pleader, diplomat, doctor of laws or in
medicine, or a learned physician.</p>

<p>When the consultant be an unmarried lady, this
card assures her that her admirer is a man of excessive
probity and of honorable intentions, that is,
if the <i>king of diamonds</i> likewise comes out upright.
To a married woman it denotes that her property
or honor will be in the keeping of a lawyer or agent
of rectitude, who will rescue her from the machinations
of enemies or spoliators. To a widow it
shows that her second marriage will be to a man of
eminence, who will render her after life most happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card signifies
a widower, a man in anger or difficulty, also one
given to inebriety. But taken in a general acceptation,
this card represents a <i>wicked man</i>, and,
through induction, <i>wickedness</i>. In that case, its
secondary significance can be gleaned from the synonyms,
used to give expression to it, as follows:</p>

<p>Bad intentioned; innate wickedness; perversity;
perfidy; crime; cruelty; inhumanity, and atrocity.</p>

<p>This card is likewise regarded as an unfortunate
one, as it forewarns you of the utter wreck of your
expectations, wrought by some one of the following
causes:</p>

<p>Reverses; prejudice; theft; violence; corruption;
elopement; libertinage; debauchery; slander;
malice; exposure of secrets; disorder in morals, or
calumny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  As the repre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>sentative
of an individual this card designates a
dark lady, with dark eyes and black hair, naturally
of an open and generous disposition, but who will
change her nature through flattery and her position
in society. Should she be possessed of beauty, her
innocence will be in perpetual danger, and only
saved through the exercise of a strong will, or
through motives of self-respect.</p>

<p>This card likewise, when emerging upright, designates
a <i>widow</i>, without respect to color or social
position, and is also taken to signify the condition
of widowhood, to be interpreted, as the oracle demands,
by these synonyms:</p>

<p>Privation; abstinence; absence; scarcity; sterility;
poverty; indigence; famine; deprivation.</p>

<p>Frequently this card is employed to denote a
<i>well-founded distrust</i>, when its secondary significations
will be:</p>

<p>Just suspicion; legitimate fear; merited doubts;
conjectures; surmises based on fact; conscientious
scruples; timidity; bashfulness; reluctance; retirement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  As a representative
of an individual, this card, coming out in the
oracle reversed in position, denotes a widow, desirous
of contracting another marriage. It moreover
designates a dark woman of amorous propensities,
who does not hesitate to disregard the conventionalities
of society.</p>

<p>But as a general thing, this card is assumed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
signify a <i>crafty evil-minded woman</i>, and can be interpreted
as:</p>

<p>Malignity; malice; finesse; artifice; cunning;
craft; dissimulation; frolic; pranks; wildness; hypocrisy;
bigotry; prudishness; wantonness; shamelessness.</p>

<p>When coming reversed in a consultation upon
marriage, this card denotes that difficulties and impediments,
generally originating with a female, will
be interposed to prevent the desired nuptials.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  As the representative
of an individual, this card, coming out upright,
designates a dark complexioned unmarried man, an
obliging fellow, who does not hesitate to accommodate
his friends at serious disadvantage to himself,
if occasion require.</p>

<p>The primary signification of the card is, however,
<i>messenger</i>, an envoy, or person, charged with
bearing of intelligence, most generally employed as
a go-between in intrigues, or in a capacity of
trust.</p>

<p>Sometimes this card is used to designate a <i>critic</i>,
or a critical position; a moment of impending danger;
an awkward predicament; a decisive instant;
an unfortunate situation; a delicate circumstance;
a threatened calamity; a crisis; or a perplexing
misstep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card is one
of evil omen to lovers, as it forewarns a betrayal of
their secrets, or the exposure of their plans by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
corrupt messenger, or through the intervention of
some intermeddler.</p>

<p>Its primary signification, when the card is reversed,
is that of a <i>Paul Pry</i>, or spy, whence we
have the secondary ones of inquirer, spectator,
watcher, overseer, as well as the result of such a
man's investigations. Hence applied more generally,
the card signifies scrutiny; examination; reports;
remarks; notations, and commentaries.</p>

<p>Another secondary signification of this card is
<i>traitor</i>, from which we readily obtain the following
synonyms:</p>

<p>Deception; duplicity; stratagem; disguise; prevarication;
disloyalty; breach of trust; conspiracy;
tale bearing; imposture; black heartedness; perfidy;
falsehood; dissimulation and breach of confidence.</p>

<p>The card is, moreover, used to forewarn lovers
that there is danger of their being pursued in event
of elopement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ace of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  This card, coming
out in natural position, and intervening between the
representative cards of a male and female, relates
wholly to love affairs. When accompanied by the
<i>ten of spades</i> it shows that an intrigue will be accompanied
with a deal of sorrow and affliction, and
will ultimately end in abandonment under most disastrous
circumstances.</p>

<p>One of the primary significations of this card is
a <i>paper</i> or document, chiefly appertaining to law<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
matters, such as warrants for arrest, writs, subp[oe]nas
and legal pleadings.</p>

<p>Another is that of a <i>ship</i>, or other means of conveyance
by water, particularly when accompanied
by the <i>eight of clubs</i>, reversed, which betokens the
consultant to be on the eve of a sea voyage, or other
journey over water of some description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ace of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  When in the oracle
of a married consultant, this card appears reversed,
and near to her representative, its primary
signification is <i>pregnancy</i>, which in her case can be
expressed by the following synonyms:</p>

<p>Conception; maternity; accouchement; childbirth.</p>

<p>From this we derive a secondary signification,
applicable to other things, for which we employ
correspondent synonyms:</p>

<p>Enlargement; engenderment; fecundity; fertilization;
production; composition; increase; augmentation;
multiplication; deliverance; parturition;
growth; addition.</p>

<p>When reversed and accompanied by the <i>knave of
clubs</i>, likewise reversed, this card is a premonitor
of <i>death</i>.</p>

<p>The general secondary signification of this card,
when reversed and in the body of the oracle, is a
<i>fall</i>, whence we have:</p>

<p>Decadence; decline; discouragement; dissipation;
ravage; ruin; demolition; destruction; bankruptcy;
error; fault; overwhelming sorrows; perdition; an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
abyss; precipice; gulf; waterfall; disgrace; shame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  The general signification
of this card is <i>jealousy</i>, particularly when
accompanied by the <i>knave of clubs</i>, which denotes
that the consultant, either male or female, is jealous
of his or her sweetheart to such a degree that their
friendly relations are in danger of being broken
off, which will assuredly be the case, if the <i>nine of
spades</i> should likewise appear in the oracle.</p>

<p>The other primary signification of this card is
<i>tears</i>, whence we derive a series of secondary significations,
as:</p>

<p>Sighs; groans; weeping; complaints; lamentations;
griefs; sadness; heart-sickness; affliction;
mental agony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card, emerging
reversed, has, for a general signification, a <i>loss</i>,
either moral or physical, as the surrounding cards
designate. Thus, with the <i>nine of hearts</i> intervening
between the consultant and this card, it announces
that he or she will lose a situation or employment.
When it comes preceded by the <i>ten of
clubs</i>, it betokens the loss of money or valuables.
Should the consultant be an unmarried female, and
this card comes out reversed near to a knave, likewise
reversed, it foretells the ruin of her reputation
through calumny. But if in place of one of the
knaves the <i>seven of clubs</i> should appear, the loss of
her character will be brought about through some
indiscretion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Another primary signification of this is <i>the evening</i>,
as a designation of points of time; still this
general term of night has given rise to the application
of important secondary significations, of which
the sense can be taken from the synonyms:</p>

<p>Shades; obscurely; nocturnal; mysterious; secret;
masked; concealed; undiscovered; clandestine;
occult; veiled; allegorical; hidden meaning; in secrecy;
obscure hints; double meaning; on the sly;
to conceal from sight; nocturnal meetings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nine of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  This is justly regarded
to be the most unfortunate card in the pack,
as it portends maladies, malignant diseases, family
dissensions, defeat in enterprises, constant disappointment,
and even death. The primary significations
of this card, when in its natural position,
are a <i>priest</i>, <i>mourning</i> and <i>disappointment</i>.</p>

<p>The secondary significations, derived from these
sources, are:</p>

<p>From the <i>priest</i>: Pastor; church; church services;
ritual; sanctity; piety; devotion; religious
ceremonies; celibacy.</p>

<p>From <i>mourning</i>: Regret; desolation; affliction;
sadness; sorrow; calamity; grief; heart-pain;
funeral; burial; tomb; grave; church-yard; loss of
relatives; wailing.</p>

<p>From <i>disappointment</i>: Obstacles; hindrance;
delay; disadvantage; contrarieties; misfortunes;
suffering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nine of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  When this card<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
appears in the oracle reversed its evil influence is
augmented two-fold, although its primary significations
are modestly expressed as <i>failure</i>, <i>abandonment</i>
and <i>delay</i>. The secondary significations are
of the most disastrous character.</p>

<p>The synonyms employed for these terms, in this
instance, are:</p>

<p>Misery; indigence; famine; necessity; need;
poverty; adversity; misfortune; deep affliction; disagreements;
correction; chastisement; punishment;
reverses; disgrace; imprisonment; detention; arrest;
captivity.</p>

<p>But when this card, reversed, comes before the
consultant and the <i>eight of spades</i>, in the same oracle,
it signifies <i>mortality</i>, with the following synonyms:</p>

<p>Death; decease; last sigh; end; finish; extinction;
annihilation; destruction; utter ruin; abjection;
humiliation; prostration; depression; alteration;
poisoning; corruption; putrefaction; paralysis;
lethargy.</p>

<p>Still in all these sinister aspects the influence of
this card can be materially modified, but never counteracted,
through intervention of bright cards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eight of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  This card is ordinarily
of bad import, as its primary signification is
<i>sickness</i>, although it is more generally interpreted as
<i>bad news</i>. This is its acceptation when preceded
by the <i>knave of spades</i> or the <i>knave of diamonds</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
or when accompanied by the <i>ace of diamonds</i>, and
sometimes by the <i>eight of hearts</i>, reversed.</p>

<p>When this card signifies <i>sickness</i>, its synonyms
are:</p>

<p>Illness of the body, soul or mind; bad condition
of health or of business; derangement; infirmity;
epidemic; gangrene; agony; displeasure; damage;
mishap; accidental injury; disaster; indisposition;
head-ache; heart-ache; inquietude; melancholy;
medicine; remedy; charlatan; empiric; physician;
quack; languor.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, this card is employed to designate
<i>prudence</i>, whence we have as secondary significations:</p>

<p>Wisdom; reserve; circumspection; reticence; discernment;
foresight; presentiment; prediction; divination;
prophecy; horoscope; second sight; clairvoyance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eight of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  Unlike other
cards, the reversal of this one brings with it a modification
of its primary significations. Hence, when
coming out reversed, it most generally signifies <i>ambition</i>,
a passion for which we have synonyms as follows:</p>

<p>Desire; wish for; search after; cupidity; jealousy;
aspiration; onward; higher; illusion; pride.</p>

<p>Another primary signification bestowed upon this
card when emerging reversed, is that of a <i>nun</i> or
pious woman, whence we derive the secondary sig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>nification
usually applied to this card and expressed
in the synonyms:</p>

<p>Inaction; peace; tranquillity; repose; apathy;
inertia; stagnation; rest from labor; pastime, recreation;
nonchalance; free from care; idleness; supineness;
lethargy; torpidity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seven of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  As a general exponent
of current events, this card is taken to forewarn
the consultant of the loss of a valuable friend,
whose death will be a source of a great deal of misery.
On this account many interpret this card to
signify a <i>coffin</i>, which may be the case when coming
out in close proximity to the <i>ace of spades</i> or the
<i>nine of spades</i>.</p>

<p>Its most accepted primary signification, however,
among practical cartomancists, is that of <i>hope</i>,
whence are derived the secondary ones, expressed
in the terms:</p>

<p>Trust; confidence; expectation; desire; inclination;
longing after; wish; taste for; whim; humor;
fancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seven of Spades</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card takes
a wider and an apparently contradictory scope in
its primary significations, when emerging in this
manner, being <i>good advice</i>, <i>friendship</i>, and <i>indecision</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>good advice</i> we derive, as secondary attributes:</p>

<p>Wise counsels; salutary warnings; news; an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>nouncements;
advertisements; placards; consultations;
admonitions; instruction; advice.</p>

<p>For <i>friendship</i> we have the following synonyms:</p>

<p>Attachment; affection; tenderness; benevolence;
well wishing; relation; harmony; correspondence;
connection; identity; intimacy; agreement with;
concordance; concurrence; interest; conformity;
sympathy; affinity; attraction; admiration.</p>

<p>For <i>indecision</i>, the general synonyms are employed:</p>

<p>Want of resolution; uncertainty; perplexity; inconstancy;
frivolity; lightness; variation; diversity;
vacillation; hesitation; versatile; unsteady; changeable;
whimsical; flexibility in character; unreliable;
undetermined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  As the representative
of an individual, this card designates a man of
a complexion neither very dark nor exceedingly
light, but a person with medium colored brown hair,
grayish eyes, and of an easy, plodding disposition.
He will be a man humane, honest and affectionate,
given to business, and faithful in all his engagements;
he will be personally happy in all his relations
in life, as father, husband and citizen, and make
everyone happy about him.</p>

<p>The primary significations of this card are, in the
first instance, a <i>friend</i>, and secondly, a <i>business
man</i>.</p>

<p>As a <i>business man</i> this card has these synonyms:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Merchant; trader; dealer; banker; broker; exchange
agent; speculator; calculator; physician;
schoolmaster; collegian; geometry; freemason;
mathematics; engineer; science; professor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card, as the
representative of an individual, designates a person
of middling dark complexion, with chestnut brown
hair, who, without being positively wicked, is
viciously inclined, and for that reason should not be
trusted. Being of a morbid temperament, he will
destroy the happiness of others, and render his family
miserable through his own viciousness.</p>

<p>A secondary signification is consequently a <i>vicious
man</i> or <i>vice</i> itself, expressed in synonyms as follows:</p>

<p>Vice; defect; default; moral blemish; weakness;
moral imperfection; unformed nature; irregularity;
flightiness of mind; depravation in manners; libertinism;
lewdness; licentious speech; ugliness; deformity;
corruption; stench; rottenness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  As a representative
of a particular individual, this card designates
a brunette lady, of a warm, tender, and sympathetic
nature, intellectual, witty and high spirited, of a
strongly loving disposition, given to society and social
reunions, where she distinguishes herself through
her conversational ability.</p>

<p>The most prominent primary signification of this
card is <i>opulence</i>, which is represented in the following
synonyms:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Riches; display; pomp; ostentation; vain show;
pageantry; luxury; sumptuousness; assurance;
steadiness; confidence; certitude; affirmation; security;
hardihood; self-reliance; liberty; frankness;
candor; openness; plain-dealing; freedom.</p>

<p>Another signification of this card is a <i>parley</i> or
<i>conference</i>, and is expressed by some of the subjoined
synonyms:</p>

<p>Discourse; conversation; talk; communication;
colloquy; dissertation; deliberation; discussion;
speech; pronunciation; grammar; dictionary;
tongue; idiom; jargon; slang; exchange; commerce;
trade; traffic; to speak; to confer; to converse; to
tattle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  As a representative
of an individual, this card, reversed, denotes
a lady whose complexion is brunette, with dark hair
and black eyes, but not dark enough to be represented
by a <i>spade</i>. She will be a woman of warm
passions, of fine personal appearance, given to coquetry
and dependent more upon her natural charms
than education or intellectual training for conquests
in her flirtations.</p>

<p>The general signification of this card, reversed,
however, is <i>ignorance</i> in contradistinction to its attributes
when in natural position, and therefore can
be interpreted as:</p>

<p>Boorishness; unskillfulness; want of experience;
untutored; impertinent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  As a representative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of an individual, this card denotes a young man of
middling dark complexion, kind, gentle and docile
by nature, sedate and domestic in his habits, and
studious through inclination. He is a warm friend
and faithful admirer.</p>

<p>Coming out in the oracle of a young lady, this
card is the representative of her lover, without respect
to his color or other qualifications, denoting
simply the person indicated.</p>

<p>The primary signification of this card, divested of
its representative character, is a <i>scholar</i> or lover of
knowledge, while its secondary attributes are expressed
in the synonyms:</p>

<p>Study; instruction; application; meditation; reflection;
labor; toil; work; occupation; apprentice;
student; disciple; pupil; master.</p>

to its surroundings in the oracle, is <i>prodigality</i>,

<p>Profusion; superfluity; luxury; largess; bounty;
sumptuousness; magnificence; liberality; benefits;
generosity; charity; benevolence; a crowd; a multitude;
depredation; dilapidation; pillage; dissipation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  As a representative
of an individual, this card designates a bachelor,
a shade darker, and of a more determined character
than the young man above described. It may likewise
represent that same young man in a state of
anger or on a sick bed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Its especial signification, however, is <i>delirium</i>,
whence we have as secondary attributes or synonyms:</p>

<p>Frenzy; aberration of mind; wandering of the
brain; unseated reason; fury; rage; fever; enthusiasm;
imbecility; imprudence; distraction; apathy;
delirium tremens; intoxication; brain fever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ace of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  This card is universally
regarded as a most fortunate one, inasmuch
as it betokens vast wealth, personal prosperity,
physical health, mental tranquillity, marital happiness
and longevity.</p>

<p>The principal significations of this card are <i>a
purse of money</i> and <i>riches</i>, whence we have as synonyms:</p>

<p>For <i>a purse of money</i>: Sum of money; a present;
capital; principal; treasure; bullion; gold and silver
wares; opulence; rare; dear; precious; inestimable;

<p>For <i>riches</i>: Wealth; health; prosperity; worldly
goods; happiness; felicity; amelioration; improvement;
benefit; advantage; profit; blessing; favor;
grace; plenty; destiny; chance; speculation; good
luck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ace of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  When this card
emerges to form part of an oracle, in a reversed
position, its more popular and current significations
are <i>nobility</i>, <i>love</i> and <i>a present</i>, but in a consultation
made for a young unmarried lady it signifies that
she will unexpectedly unite herself with a man, prob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>ably
a widower, who will better her fortunes; hence
to a female operative this card is a very good omen.</p>

<p>For <i>nobility</i> we employ as appropriate synonyms:</p>

<p>A nobleman; a man of consequence; important;
great; the eldest son; extended; vast; sublime; renowned;
illustrious; powerful; elevated; of good
quality; illustration; reputation; consideration;

taste for; propensity; admiration; gallantry; complacence
for the sex; intrigue; affinity; an affair of

<p><span class="smcap">Ten of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  When this card enters
in your oracle it is to apprise you that you will
unexpectedly receive a handsome sum of money, a
gift or a legacy from some dear friend or near relative.
However, at the same time it warns you that
your smiles will be intermingled with tears; inasmuch
as you will almost simultaneously learn of the
death of some person whose love you have cherished.</p>

<p>The chief primary signification of this card is
<i>the future</i>, whence are derived the following secondary
ones:</p>

<p>Hereafter; to come; posthumous; after death;
heaven.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Another primary signification is <i>gain</i>, which can
be interpreted as required, by any of these synonyms:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  As a general thing
this card, emerging reversed, designates a <i>lover</i>, of
either gender, unless the <i>knave of clubs</i> appears in
the oracle of a lady, or the <i>eight of hearts</i>, reversed,
in that of a gentleman.</p>

measure of time, is <i>the present</i>, whence we have as
synonyms:</p>

<p>At the instant; actually; now; presently; suddenly;
unexpectedly; upon the spot; momentarily;

this nature:</p>

<p>For sure; with certainty; in consequence; result;
evidence; conviction; conclusion; will happen;
event; to finish; to execute; household goods; furniture;

<p><span class="smcap">Nine of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  This card, reversed,
is most usually employed to denote that the
consultant, in whose oracle it appears, will be the
recipient of a <i>present</i>, but as to its value and its
nature the surrounding cards must determine. The
card consequently may represent:</p>

<p>Gift; presentation; memorial; offering; testi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>monial;
a gratification; service; offer of money;
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Another signification of this card when coming
out reversed, is <i>gambling</i>, but as this is a serious
moral offense, great care should be exercised to study
its application.</p>

<p>From <i>gambling</i> are derived these secondary meanings:</p>

<p>Games of chance; lottery; luck; card playing;
any fortuitous circumstance; by accident; destiny;
human life; cards; dice; money games; disreputable
company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eight of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  As a representative
of an individual, this card designates a brunette,
unmarried lady, remarkable for her personal attractions,
of a mild and tractable nature, who, should
she not possess beauty, will win admiration from her
accomplishments and demeanor, as well as from her
sincerity and virtue.</p>

<p>As a general thing this card signifies <i>the art of
pleasing</i>, or, as it is more appropriately styled, <i>a
virtuous girl</i>, in which connection, its meaning is expressed
in the synonyms:</p>

<p>A virgin; chaste; modest; virtuous; genteel; becoming;
decent; decorous; suitable; befitting; civil;
kind; courteous; polished; polite; well bred; accomplished;
condescending; meek; hospitable; good

<p><span class="smcap">Eight of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Reversed</i>. &nbsp;  As an individ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>ual's
representative, this card, when reversed, denotes
a middling dark complexioned unmarried
woman, with dark chestnut hair, and eyes nearly
approaching black in color. She will be vain of
her personal charms, and make little account of the
world's opinion should her own desires be gratified.</p>

<p>The primary signification of this card is <i>removal</i>
or <i>departure</i>, and can be appropriately expressed in
the following synonyms:</p>

remote; absence; separation; dispersion;

immodest; unchaste; insincere; boorish;
brazen faced; slovenly; a virago; a tartar; a wanton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seven of Clubs</span>&mdash;<i>Upright</i>. &nbsp;  The principal primary
signification of this card is a <i>trifle in money</i>,
but which, however, has been amplified to designate
<i>economy</i>, or the art of spending very little money to
the best advantage. Consequently from this
source we have the following synonyms:</p>

<p>Good behavior; wise administration of affairs;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
foresight; discretion; order; regularity; household
virtues; good management; wisdom; happiness;

<p>This card likewise signifies <i>company</i> or <i>sociability</i>,
in which connection it can be taken to denote:</p>

<p>Association; an assembly; a gathering; family
party; friendly intercourse; pleasant relations;
harmless pastimes; domestic recreations; balls; concerts;
theater.</p>

<p>Still, its most important signification is a <i>child</i>.
From this physical object the secondary meanings
of this card are extended to designate the characteristics
of childhood applied to after life. Hence the
synonyms of this signification are:</p>

<p>Infancy; childhood; puerility; frivolity; weakness;
dependency; abasement; humiliation; depression;

<h3>A WORD OF ADVICE.</h3>

<p>It will be found of material assistance to the
complete understanding of each of the following
methods of telling fortunes to have in your hands
a 32-card pack as you read, and to carefully follow
out the details with the exact cards mentioned
in the text. We strongly recommend this plan to
the student who desires to become an adept in the
art.</p>


<h3>SPECIAL NOTE.</h3>

<p>In all the following methods the 32-card pack is
used, which consists of the ace, king, queen, jack,
ten, nine, eight and seven only of each suit, and
usually the extra Consultant card to represent the
person consulting the cards.</p>

<p>When about to consult the oracle, the cards
should be arranged in the following manner before
shuffling: King, queen, jack, ace, ten, nine, eight
and seven of each suit. This precaution should
be taken for every consultation, whether for yourself
or for another person, as without this the permutation
may chance not to be perfect.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="DEALING_THE_CARDS_BY" id="DEALING_THE_CARDS_BY"></a>DEALING THE CARDS BY
THREES</h2>


<p>The pack of thirty-two selected cards is taken,
and a card is selected to represent the dealer, supposing
he is making the essay on his own behalf;
if not, it must represent the person for whom he
is acting. In doing this, if the Consultant card
be not used, it is necessary to remember that the
card chosen should be according to the complexion
of the chooser. King or queen of diamonds for a
very fair person; king or queen of hearts for one
rather dark; clubs for one darker still; and spades
only for one very dark indeed. The card chosen
also loses its signification, and simply becomes the
representative of a dark or fair man or woman as
the case may be. This point having been settled,
the cards are shuffled, and either cut by the dealer
or for him (according to whether he is acting for
himself or another person), the left hand being used.
That done, they are turned up by threes, and every
time two of the same suit are found in these triplets,
such as two hearts, two clubs, etc., the highest
card is withdrawn and placed on the table in front.
If the triplet chance to be all the same suit, the
highest card is still to be the only one withdrawn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
but should it consist of three of the same value,
such as three kings, etc., they are all to be appropriated.
If after having turned up the cards, three
by three, six have been able to be withdrawn, there
will remain twenty-six, which are shuffled and cut,
and again turned up by threes, acting precisely as
before, until thirteen, fifteen or seventeen cards have
been obtained. The number must always be uneven,
and the card representing the person consulting
must be amongst the number; if not, it must
be drawn out and put at the end.</p>

<p>Say that the person whose fortune is being read
is a lady, represented by the queen of hearts, and
that fifteen cards are obtained and laid out in the
form of a semi-circle in the order they were drawn:
The seven of clubs, the ten of diamonds, the seven
of hearts, the jack of clubs, the king of diamonds,
the nine of diamonds, the ten of hearts, the queen
of spades, the eight of hearts, the jack of diamonds,
the queen of hearts, the nine of clubs, the seven of
spades, the ace of clubs, the eight of spades. The
cards having been considered, there are found
among them two queens, two jacks, two tens, three
sevens, two eights and two nines. It is therefore
possible to announce:&mdash;"The two queens are supposed
to signify the re-union of friends; the two
jacks, that there is mischief being made between
them. These two tens, a change, which, from one
of them being between two sevens, will not be effected
without some difficulty; the cause of which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
according to these three sevens, will be illness.
However, these two nines can promise some small
gain; resulting, so say these two eights, from a love
affair."</p>

<p>Seven cards are now counted from right to left,
beginning with the queen of hearts, who represents
the lady consulting the cards. The seventh being
the king of diamonds, the following may be said:
"You often think of a fair man in uniform."</p>

<p>The next seventh card (counting the king of diamonds
as one) proves to be the ace of clubs: "You
will receive from him some very joyful tidings; he,
besides, intends making you a present."</p>

<p>Count the ace of clubs as one, and proceeding to
the next seventh card, the queen of spades: "A
widow is endeavoring to injure you on this very
account; and (the seventh card counting the queen
as one being the ten of diamonds) the annoyance
she gives you will oblige you to either take a journey
or change your residence; but (this ten of diamonds
being imprisoned between two sevens) your
journey or removal will meet with some obstacle."</p>

<p>On proceeding to count as before, calling the ten
of diamonds one, the seventh card will be found to
be the queen of hearts herself, the person consulting;
therefore, the conclusion may be stated as:
"But this you will overcome of yourself, without
needing anyone's aid or assistance."</p>

<p>The two cards at either extremity of the half
circle are now taken, which are respectively the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
eight of spades and seven of clubs, and may be
read: "A sickness which will result in your receiving
a small sum of money."</p>

<p>Repeat the same maneuver, which brings together
the ace of clubs and the ten of diamonds:</p>

<p>"Good news, which will make you decide on taking
a journey, destined to prove a very happy one,
and which will occasion you to receive a sum of
money."</p>

<p>The next cards united, being the seven of spades
and the seven of hearts, you say:</p>

<p>"Tranquillity and peace of mind, followed by
slight anxiety, quickly followed by love and happiness."</p>

<p>Then come the nine of clubs and the jack of
clubs: "You will certainly receive money through
the exertions of a clever dark young man."</p>

<p>Queen of hearts and king of diamonds: "Which
comes from a fair man in uniform. This recontre
announces great happiness in store for you, and
the complete fulfillment of your wishes."</p>

<p>Jack of diamonds and nine of diamonds: "Although
this happy result will be delayed some time
through a fair young man, not famed for his delicacy."</p>

<p>Eight of hearts and ten of hearts: "Love, joy
and triumph."</p>

<p>"The queen of spades, who remains alone, is
the widow endeavoring to injure you, and finds herself
deserted by all her friends."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>The cards that have been in use are now gathered
up and shuffled and cut with the left hand.
They are then made into three packs by dealing
one to the left, one to the middle, and one to the
right; a fourth is laid aside to form "a surprise."
Then the cards are continued to be dealt to each
of the three packs in turn until their number is exhausted,
when it will be found that the left hand
and middle packs contain each five cards, while the
one on the right hand consists of only four.</p>

<p>The person consulting is now asked to select one
of the three packs. Supposing this to be the middle
one, and that the cards comprising it are the
jack of diamonds, the king of diamonds, the seven
of spades, the queen of spades, the seven of clubs;
recollecting the previous instructions regarding the
individual and the supposed relative signification
of the cards, they may be easily interpreted as follows:
"The jack of diamonds&mdash;a fair young man
possessed of no delicacy of feeling, seeks to injure&mdash;the
king of diamonds&mdash;a fair man in uniform&mdash;seven
of spades&mdash;and will succeed in causing
him some annoyance&mdash;the queen of spades&mdash;at
the instigation of a spiteful woman&mdash;seven of
clubs&mdash;but by means of a small sum of money
matters will be easily arranged."</p>

<p>The left hand pack is next taken up, which is
"for the house" the former one having been for
the lady herself.</p>

<p>Supposing it to consist of the queen of hearts, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
jack of clubs, the eight of hearts, the nine of diamonds
and the ace of clubs, they would be read
thus: "Queen of hearts&mdash;the lady whose fortune
is being told is or soon will be in a house&mdash;jack
of clubs&mdash;where she will meet with a dark young
man, who&mdash;eight of hearts&mdash;will entreat her assistance
to forward his interests with a fair girl&mdash;nine
of diamonds&mdash;he having met with delay
and disappointment&mdash;ace of clubs&mdash;but a letter
will arrive announcing the possession of money,
which will remove all difficulties."</p>

<p>The third pack is "for those who do not expect
it," and will be composed of four cards: the ten
of hearts, the nine of clubs, eight of spades, and
ten of diamonds: "The ten of hearts&mdash;an unexpected
piece of good fortune and great happiness&mdash;nine
of clubs&mdash;caused by an unlooked for legacy&mdash;eight
of spades&mdash;which joy may be followed
by a short sickness&mdash;ten of diamonds&mdash;the
result of a fatiguing journey."</p>

<p>There now remains on the table only the card intended
for "the surprise." This, however, must
be left untouched, the other cards gathered up,
shuffled, cut, and again laid out in three packs, not
forgetting at the first deal to add a card to "the
surprise." After the different packs have been duly
examined and explained as before described, they
must again be gathered up, shuffled, etc., indeed
the whole operation repeated, after which, the three
cards forming "the surprise" are examined, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
supposing them to be the seven of hearts, the jack
of clubs and the queen of spades, they are to be
thus interpreted: "Seven of hearts&mdash;pleasant
thoughts and friendly intentions&mdash;jack of clubs&mdash;of
a dark young man&mdash;queen of spades&mdash;relative
to a malicious dark woman, who will cause him
much unhappiness."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="DEALING_THE_CARDS_BY_FIVES" id="DEALING_THE_CARDS_BY_FIVES"></a>DEALING THE CARDS BY FIVES</h2>


<p>Shuffle the 32-card pack thoroughly and cut it
twice with the left hand, placing the first cut face
downward at the right hand and the second on the
left.</p>

<p>Now take off the top card of the middle package
and place it aside, and repeat the shuffling and
cutting of the balance in a precisely similar manner,
and again remove the top card of the middle
package. Repeat shuffling, cutting and discarding
until you have in this way taken out five cards.
This done, examine if the Consultant be among the
number of cards taken from the pack. If it be,
shuffle the five cards well, and then deal them in a
row, turning their faces up from right to left in
this manner:</p>

<p class="center">
5, 4, 3, 2, 1<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">and proceed to read them from the same direction.</p>

<p>If the Consultant be not found among the five
cards drawn as above, take it from the pack and
substitute it for one taken by chance from the five
cards after shuffling them thoroughly, faces down,
so that the card to be discarded shall not be recognized.
After placing the Consultant among the
other four cards, shuffle well and deal as directed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and you have your oracle of five cards for consultation
and explanation, and among which the Consultant
will appear in its proper position.</p>

<p>As an example, let us say that the five cards obtained
are, from right to left, as follows: Ten of
hearts, ten of clubs, Consultant, eight of clubs reversed
and ten of diamonds.</p>

<p>The Consultant having behind him the eight of
clubs near to the ten of diamonds, these two cards
announce to him his residence at a distance in a
foreign city, and the two tens which are found
placed behind him notifies that he is about to quit
his house (ten of clubs) and the city (ten of hearts)
where he now lives.</p>

<h2><a name="DEALING_THE_CARDS_BY_SEVENS" id="DEALING_THE_CARDS_BY_SEVENS"></a>DEALING THE CARDS BY SEVENS</h2>


<p>After having shuffled the pack of thirty-two selected
cards either cut them yourself or, if acting
for another person, let that person cut them, taking
care to use the left hand. Then count seven
cards, beginning with the one lying on the top of
the pack. The first six are useless, so put them
aside, and retain only the seventh, which is to be
placed face uppermost on the table before you. Repeat
this three times more, then shuffle and cut the
cards you have thrown on one side, together with
those remaining in your hand, and tell them out
in sevens as before, until you have thus obtained
twelve cards. It is however indispensable that the
Consultant card or one representing the person
whose fortune is being told should be among the
number; therefore the whole operation must be recommenced
in case of it not having made its appearance.
Your twelve cards being now spread out
before you in the order in which they have come to
hand, you may begin to explain them as described
in the manner of dealing the cards in threes&mdash;always
bearing in mind both their individual and relative
signification. Thus, you first count the cards
by sevens, beginning with the one representing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
person for whom you are acting, going from right
to left. Then take the two cards at either extremity
of the line or half-circle, and unite them, and
afterwards form the three heaps or packs and "the
surprise" precisely as we have before described.
Indeed, the only difference between this and the
three card method is the manner in which the cards
are obtained.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="DEALING_BY_FIFTEENS" id="DEALING_BY_FIFTEENS"></a>DEALING BY FIFTEENS</h2>


<p>After the cards have been well shuffled and cut,
they are dealt out in two packs containing sixteen
cards in each. The person consulting is desired
to choose one of them; the first card is laid aside
to form "the surprise," the other fifteen are turned
up and ranged in a half circle before the dealer,
going from left to right, being placed in the order
in which they come to hand. If the card representing
the person consulting be not among them
the cards must be all gathered up, shuffled, cut, and
dealt as before, and this must be repeated till the
missing card makes its appearance in the pack
chosen by the person it represents. They are explained,
first, by interpreting the meaning of any
pairs, triplets, or quartettes among them; then by
counting them in sevens, going from right to left,
and beginning with the card representing the person
consulting, and lastly, by taking the cards at
either extremity of the line, and pairing them.
This being done, the fifteen cards are gathered up,
shuffled, cut, and dealt so as to form three packs
of five cards each. From each of these the topmost
card is withdrawn and placed on the one laid
aside for "the surprise," thus forming four packs
of four cards each.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>The person consulting is desired to choose one
of these packs for herself or for himself as the case
may be. This is turned up, and the four cards it
contains are spread out from left to right, the individual
and relative signification ascribed to them
being duly explained. In like manner the pack on
the left, which will be "for the house," is used;
then the third one, "for those who do not expect
it;" and lastly, "the surprise."</p>

<p>In order to make the meaning perfectly clear another
example is given. It is supposed that the
pack for the person consulting consists of the jack
of hearts, the ace of diamonds, the queen of clubs
and the eight of spades reversed.</p>

<p>It will be easy to interpret them as follows:
"The jack of hearts&mdash;a gay young bachelor&mdash;the
ace of diamonds&mdash;who has written, or who will
very soon write a letter&mdash;the queen of clubs&mdash;to
a dark woman&mdash;eight of spades reversed&mdash;to
make proposals to her, which will not be accepted."
On looking back to the list of significations, it will
be found to run thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Jack of Hearts&mdash;A gay young bachelor who
thinks only of pleasure.</p>

<p>Ace of Diamonds&mdash;A letter, soon to be received.</p>

<p>Queen  of  Clubs&mdash;An  affectionate woman, but
quick tempered and touchy.</p>

<p>Eight of Spades&mdash;If reversed, a marriage broken
off, or offer refused.</p></div>

<p>It will thus be seen that each card forms, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
it were, a phrase, from an assemblage of which nothing
but a little practice is required to form complete
sentences. Of this a further example will be
given by interpreting the signification of the three
other packs.</p>

<p>"For the house" is supposed to consist of the
queen of hearts, the jack of spades reversed, the
ace of clubs and the nine of diamonds, which are
supposed to read thus: "The queen of hearts&mdash;a
fair woman, mild and amiable in disposition&mdash;jack
of spades reversed&mdash;will be deceived by a
dark, ill bred young man&mdash;the ace of clubs&mdash;but
she will receive some good news, which will console
her&mdash;nine of diamonds&mdash;although it is probable
that this news may be delayed."</p>

<p>The pack "for those who do not expect it," consists
of the queen of diamonds, the king of spades,
the ace of hearts reversed, and the seven of spades:
"The queen of diamonds&mdash;a mischief-making
woman&mdash;the king of spades&mdash;in league with a dishonest
lawyer&mdash;-ace of hearts reversed&mdash;they will
hold a consultation&mdash;seven of spades&mdash;but the
harm they will do will soon be repaired."</p>

<p>Last comes "the surprise," formed by, it is supposed,
the jack of clubs, the ten of diamonds, the
queen of spades and the nine of spades, of which
the supposed interpretation is: "The jack of
clubs&mdash;a clever, enterprising young man&mdash;ten of
diamonds&mdash;about to undertake a journey&mdash;queen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of spades&mdash;for the purpose of visiting a widow&mdash;nine
of spades&mdash;but one or both their lives will
be endangered."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TWENTY-ONE_CARD" id="THE_TWENTY-ONE_CARD"></a>THE TWENTY-ONE CARD
METHOD</h2>


<p>After the thirty-two cards have been shuffled and
cut with the left hand, the first eleven are withdrawn
from the pack and laid on one side. The
remainder&mdash;twenty-one in all&mdash;are to be again
shuffled and cut, that being done, the topmost card
is laid on one side to form "the surprise," and the
remaining twenty are ranged before the dealer in
the order in which they come to hand. If the card
representing the person consulting be not among
them, one must be withdrawn from the eleven useless
ones placed at the right extremity of the row,
where it represents the missing card, no matter what
it may really be. Let us suppose that the person
wishing to make the essay is an officer in the army,
and consequently represented by the king of diamonds,
and that the twenty cards ranged in front
of you are: Queen of diamonds, king of clubs, ten
of hearts, ace of spades, queen of hearts reversed,
seven of spades, jack of diamonds, ten of clubs, king
of spades, eight of diamonds, king of hearts, nine
of clubs, jack of spades reversed, seven of hearts,
ten of spades, king of diamonds, ace of diamonds,
seven of clubs, nine of hearts, ace of clubs. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
now proceed to examine the cards as they lay, and
perceiving that all the four kings are there, you
can predict that great rewards await the person
consulting you, and that he will gain great dignity
and honor. The two queens, one of them reversed,
announce the reunion of two sorrowful friends; the
three aces, foretell good news; the two jacks, one
of them reversed, danger; the three tens, improper
conduct.</p>

<p>You now begin to explain the cards, commencing
with the first on the left hand: "The queen of diamonds
is a mischief-making, under-bred woman&mdash;the
king of clubs&mdash;endeavoring to win the affections
of a worthy and estimable man&mdash;ten of hearts&mdash;over
whose scruples she will triumph&mdash;ace of
spades&mdash;the affair will make some noise&mdash;queen
of hearts reversed&mdash;and greatly distress a charming
fair woman who loves him&mdash;seven of spades&mdash;but
her grief will not be of long duration. Jack
of diamonds&mdash;an unfaithful servant&mdash;ten of
clubs&mdash;will make away with a considerable sum
of money&mdash;king of spades&mdash;and will be brought
to trial&mdash;eight of diamonds&mdash;but saved from punishment
through a woman's agency. King of hearts&mdash;a
fair man of liberal disposition&mdash;nine of clubs&mdash;will
receive a large sum of money&mdash;jack of
spades reversed&mdash;which will expose him to the
malice of a dark youth of coarse manners. Seven
of hearts&mdash;pleasant thoughts, followed by&mdash;ten
of spades&mdash;great chagrin&mdash;king of diamonds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>&mdash;await
a man in uniform, who is the person consulting
me&mdash;ace of diamonds&mdash;but a letter he will
speedily receive&mdash;seven of clubs&mdash;containing a
small sum of money&mdash;nine of hearts&mdash;will restore
his good spirits&mdash;ace of clubs&mdash;which will be further
augmented by some good news." Now turn
up "the surprise" which it is supposed will prove
the ace of hearts, "a card that is taken to predict
great happiness, caused by a love letter, but which,
making up the four aces, is said to show that this
sudden joy will be followed by great misfortunes."</p>

<p>The cards are now gathered up, shuffled, cut, and
formed into three packs, at the first deal one being
laid aside to form "the surprise." By the time
they are all dealt out it will be found that the two
first packets are each composed of seven cards,
whilst the third contains only six. The person consulting
is desired to select one of these, which is
taken up and spread out from left to right, being
explained as before described. The cards are again
gathered up, shuffled, cut, formed into three packs,
one card being dealt to "the surprise," and then
proceeding as before. The whole operation is once
more repeated, then the three cards forming "the
surprise" are taken up and their interpretation
given.</p>

<p>No matter how the cards are dealt, whether by
threes, fives, sevens, fifteens or twenty-one, when
those lower than the jack predominate it is considered
to foretell success.   If clubs are the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
numerous, they are supposed to predict gain, considerable
fortune, etc. If picture cards, dignity
and honor; hearts, gladness, good news; spades,
death or sickness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_WAY_TO_TELL_A_FORTUNE" id="THE_WAY_TO_TELL_A_FORTUNE"></a>THE WAY TO TELL A FORTUNE</h2>


<p>Illustrating the 21-card deal and the expert
fortune-teller's method of constructing a complete
and connected reading of the same, which you
are advised to carefully consider, as a guide for
your own use in delivering an intelligent, interesting
and coherent oracle in all cases where you are
rendering an interpretation for others.</p>

<p>A man asks the question:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Shall I Marry the Woman I Love?</i></p>

<p>The fortune-teller turns the cards by the 21-card
method, with the resultant layout as shown
in the picture, and proceeds to read the gentleman's
answer in the following language:</p>

<p>You desire to learn, sir, whether you will marry
the young lady to whom you are now paying your
addresses? You inform me that the lady is a
blonde; still it is necessary for me to inform you
that in order to be able to foresee whether or not
the marriage be accomplished according to your
wishes, I am compelled to select as a representative
card of your future wife, a lady of your own color,
for such a one is necessary for the oracle, otherwise
our labors go for nothing. You, sir, are a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
middling dark man, and therefore would come up
as a <i>club</i>; as a representative card of your beloved
we will take the <i>queen of clubs</i>, as of your own complexion.</p>

<p>Now, sir, having performed our deal and arranged
the oracle, permit me, in the first place, to
call your attention to the fact that you stand represented
by the <i>knave of clubs</i>, and in the next to
observe your position in the oracle.</p>

<p>The <i>eight of hearts</i> coming as it does in company
with the <i>eight of clubs</i>, gives me satisfactory
information that you entertain for the young lady
a most profound and honorable sentiment of affection,
which it appears to me she reciprocates with
a no less degree of intensity. I have chosen to designate
your beloved by the <i>queen of clubs</i>, and she
is doubtlessly a personage well worthy of your love,
as the <i>eight of diamonds</i>, coming before her in conjunction
with the <i>ace of hearts</i>, demonstrates her
to be a lady of wisdom, intelligence and prudence.
Observe, moreover, that the <i>nine of hearts</i> intervenes
between you both, but is placed nearest the
lady. This card predicts a union, which is much
desired by her, while on your part you regard your
intended with a spirit of admiration bordering almost
upon adoration. Such a union will assuredly
be followed by domestic happiness, by peace and
concord in your domestic circle, by a reign of harmony
within your household.</p>

<p>I assure you, sir, that, scrutinizing this oracle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
from every aspect, I fail to perceive any obstacle
which can interpose to prevent your contemplated
marriage. On the other hand, the prognostications
are decidedly in its favor, for you will be pleased
to notice that the <i>eight of hearts</i> and the <i>eight of
clubs</i>, coming up side by side, and between you and
your intended, predict a success. Remark more,
that there are <i>three tens</i> at your back, which denotes
a change in your estate or an alteration in
your manner of life and social position.</p>

<p>The presence of the <i>queen of hearts</i> in immediate
vicinity to the <i>seven of diamonds</i>, indicates not
only the receipt of pleasant intelligence from a relative
able to give you assistance, but permanent prosperity
should you continue in her good graces. I
perceive, likewise, from the <i>seven of hearts</i>, that you
are at this moment thinking of visiting your intended
father-in-law, formally to demand the hand
of his daughter.</p>

<p>Do not hesitate, my dear sir, to do so, for you
will risk nothing by such an act of courtesy, as it
will be crowned with the most happy results. There
can be no doubt on that head, as the presence of
the <i>king</i>, <i>queen</i> and <i>knave of hearts</i>, coming almost
together, and blended with your new estate, assure
you of the respect and esteem of the family. True,
the young lady entertains such affection (<i>seven of
spades</i>) for her parent that when she comes to be
separated (<i>nine of diamonds</i>) from him upon marriage
(<i>king of diamonds</i>) the native impulse of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
heart will cause her to shed tears (<i>ten of spades</i>)
at the thought (<i>seven of hearts</i>) of leaving her paternal
roof (<i>ace of hearts</i>).</p>

<p>And now, sir, your surprise. It is a letter (<i>ace
of diamonds</i>), which, placed upon the last card to
the left, which is the <i>king of clubs</i>, announces to
you that you will be surprised through receipt of
a most gratifying epistle from your intended
father-in-law in relation to your approaching marriage.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ITALIAN_METHOD" id="THE_ITALIAN_METHOD"></a>THE ITALIAN METHOD</h2>


<p>Take the pack of thirty-two selected cards, shuffle
them well, and either cut or have them cut for
you, according to whether you are acting for yourself
or another person. Turn up the cards by
threes, and when the triplet is composed of cards
of the same suit, lay it aside; when of three different
suits, pass it by without withdrawing any of
the three; but when composed of two of one suit
and one of another, withdraw the higher card of the
two. When you have come to the end of the pack,
gather up all the cards except those you have withdrawn;
shuffle, cut, and again turn up by threes.
Repeat this operation until you have obtained fifteen
cards, which must then be spread out before
you, from left to right, in the order in which they
come to hand.</p>

<p>Care must, however, be taken that the card representing
the person making the essay is among them;
if not, the whole operation must be recommenced until
the desired result is obtained. We will suppose it
to be some dark lady&mdash;represented by the queen of
clubs&mdash;who is anxious to make the attempt for herself,
and that the cards are laid out in the following
order, from left to right: Ten of diamonds, queen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of clubs, eight of hearts, ace of diamonds, ten of
hearts, seven of clubs, king of spades, nine of hearts,
jack of spades, ace of clubs, seven of spades, ten of
spades, seven of diamonds, ace of spades, jack of
hearts.</p>

<p>On examining them, you will find that there are
three aces among them, announcing good news; but,
as they are at some distance from each other, that
the tidings may be some time before they arrive.</p>

<p>The three tens denote that the conduct of the
person consulting the cards has not been always
strictly correct. The two jacks are enemies, and
the three sevens predict an illness, caused by them.</p>

<p>You now begin to count five cards, beginning with
the queen of clubs, who represents the person consulting
you. The fifth card, being the seven of
clubs, announces that the lady will soon receive a
small sum of money. The next fifth card proving
to be the ace of clubs, signifies that this money will
be accompanied by some very joyful tidings. Next
comes the ace of spades, promising complete success
to any projects undertaken by the person consulting
the cards; then the eight of hearts, followed at the
proper interval by the king of spades, showing that
the good news will excite the malice of a dishonest
lawyer; but the seven of spades coming next, announces
that the annoyance he can cause will be of
short duration, and that a gay, fair young man&mdash;the
jack of hearts&mdash;will soon console her for what
she has suffered. The ace of diamonds tells that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
she will soon receive a letter from this fair young
man&mdash;the nine of hearts&mdash;announcing a great success&mdash;ten
of spades&mdash;but this will be followed by
some slight chagrin&mdash;ten of diamonds&mdash;caused by
a journey&mdash;ten of hearts&mdash;but it will soon pass,
although&mdash;jack of spades&mdash;a bad, dark young
man will endeavor&mdash;seven of diamonds&mdash;to turn
her into ridicule. The queen of clubs, being representative
of herself, shows that it is towards her that
the dark young man's malice will be directed. Now
take the cards at either extremity of the line, and
pair them together. The two first being the jack of
hearts and the ten of diamonds, you may say: "A
gay young bachelor is preparing to take a journey&mdash;ace
of spades and queen of clubs&mdash;which will
bring him to the presence of the lady consulting the
cards, and cause her great joy. Seven of diamonds
and eight of hearts&mdash;scandal talked about a fair
young girl. Ten of spades and ace of diamonds&mdash;tears
shed upon receipt of a letter. Seven of spades
and ten of hearts&mdash;great joy, mingled with slight
sorrow. Seven of clubs and ace of clubs&mdash;a letter
promising money. Jack of spades and king of
spades&mdash;the winning of a lawsuit. The nine of
hearts, being the one card left, promises complete
success."</p>

<p>Now gather up the cards, shuffle, cut, and deal
them out in five packs&mdash;one for the lady herself,
one for the house, one for "those who do not expect
it," one for "those who do expect it," and one for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
"the surprise," in the first deal, laying one card
aside for "consolation." The rest are then equally
distributed among the other five packs, which will
four of them contain three cards, whilst the last only
consists of two.</p>

<p>We will suppose the first packet for the lady herself
to be composed of the ace of diamonds, the seven
of clubs, and the ten of hearts. The interpretation
would run thus:</p>

<p>"Ace of diamonds&mdash;a letter will be shortly received&mdash;seven
of clubs&mdash;announcing the arrival of
a small sum of money&mdash;ten of hearts&mdash;and containing
some very joyful tidings."</p>

<p>The second pack, "for the house," containing the
king of spades, the nine of hearts, and the jack of
spades:</p>

<p>"The person consulting the cards will receive a
visit&mdash;king of spades&mdash;from a lawyer&mdash;nine of
hearts&mdash;which will greatly delight&mdash;jack of
spades&mdash;a dark, ill-disposed young man."</p>

<p>The third pack, "for those who do not expect it,"
composed of the ace of spades, the jack of hearts,
and the ace of clubs, would read:</p>

<p>"Ace of spades&mdash;pleasure in store for&mdash;jack
of hearts&mdash;a gay young bachelor&mdash;ace of clubs&mdash;by
means of money; but as the jack of hearts is
placed between two aces, it is evident that he runs a
great risk of being imprisoned; and from the two
cards signifying respectively 'pleasure' and
'money,' that it will be for having run into debt."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
The fourth pack, "for those who do expect it,"
containing the eight of hearts, the queen of clubs,
and the ten of diamonds:</p>

<p>"The eight of hearts&mdash;the love-affairs of a fair
young girl will oblige&mdash;the queen of clubs&mdash;the
person consulting the cards&mdash;ten of diamonds&mdash;to
take a journey."</p>

<p>The fifth pack, "for the surprise," consists of the
seven of spades and the ten of spades, meaning:</p>

<p>"Seven of spades&mdash;slight trouble&mdash;ten of
spades&mdash;caused by some person's imprisonment&mdash;the
card of consolation&mdash;seven of diamonds&mdash;which
will turn out to have been a mere report."</p>

<p>A pack is taken of thirty-two selected cards, shuffled
well and cut in three, then laid out in four rows
of eight cards each. Significator is made any king
or queen that may be preferred; then seven are
counted from that significator from left to right,
and from right to left, also crossways, always starting
from the king or queen that represents the person
consulting. The thoughts, which are supposed
to be indicated by the jacks, may then be counted
from, or the house, or a letter; in fact, anything
about which information is desired; when this is explained,
the cards are paired from each extremity,
each pair being explained as arrived at till the pack
is finished. They are now gathered up, shuffled and
cut in three; then turned up by threes, the highest
of each suit being taken out.</p>

<p>When three of equal value come together, such
as three aces, three kings, etc., they must all be taken
out; the same is to be done should three of a suit
come together; this is to be repeated three times,
shuffling and cutting between each, and when the
pack has been gone through, any that are remaining
over must be put on one side and not used. Seven
cards are counted again from significator, and paired
as before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>The person wishing to try her fortune in this manner
(we will suppose her to be a young, fair person,
represented by the eight of hearts), must well shuffle,
and cut with the left hand, the pack of thirty-two
cards; after which she must lay aside the topmost
and undermost cards, to form the surprise.
There will now remain thirty cards, which must be
dealt out in three parcels&mdash;one to the left, one in
the middle, and one to the right.</p>

<p>The left-hand pack represents the Past; the middle,
the Present; and the one on the right hand, the
Future. She must commence with the Past, which
we will suppose to contain these ten cards: The
king of clubs, ace of spades, jack of diamonds, nine
of diamonds, ace of hearts, jack of hearts, queen of
hearts, king of spades, jack of clubs, and the king of
hearts.</p>

<p>She would remark that picture-cards predominating
was a favorable sign, also that the presence of
three kings proves that powerful persons were interesting
themselves in her affairs; the three jacks,
however, are supposed to warn her to beware of false
friends; the nine of diamonds, some great annoyance
overcome by some good and amiable person, repre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>sented
by the queen of hearts; the two aces, notice
of a plot. Taking the cards in the order they lay:
"The king of clubs&mdash;a frank, open hearted man&mdash;ace
of spades&mdash;fond of gayety and pleasure,
is disliked by&mdash;jack of diamonds&mdash;an unfaithful
friend&mdash;nine of diamonds&mdash;who seeks to injure
him. The ace of hearts&mdash;a love letter&mdash;jack of
hearts&mdash;from a gay young bachelor to a fair amiable
woman&mdash;queen of hearts&mdash;causes&mdash;king of
spades&mdash;a lawyer to endeavor to injure the clever&mdash;jack
of clubs&mdash;enterprising young man, who is
saved from him by&mdash;the king of hearts&mdash;a good
and powerful man. Nevertheless, as the jack of
clubs is placed between two similar cards, he has run
great risk of being imprisoned through the machinations
of his enemy."</p>

<p>The second parcel, the Present, containing the
ten of diamonds, nine of spades, eight of spades,
queen of diamonds, queen of clubs, eight of hearts,
seven of spades, ten of spades, queen of spades,
eight of diamonds, signifies:</p>

<p>"The ten of diamonds&mdash;a voyage or journey,
at that moment taking place&mdash;nine of spades&mdash;caused
by the death or dangerous illness of someone&mdash;eight

great grief&mdash;queen of diamonds&mdash;to a fair

spades&mdash;these are occasioned by the conduct of
either a dark woman or a widow, who&mdash;eight of

<p>The third packet of cards, the Future, we will
suppose to contain the eight of clubs, ten of clubs,
seven of diamonds, ten of hearts, seven of clubs,
nine of hearts, ace of diamonds, jack of spades,
seven of hearts, and the nine of clubs, which would
read thus:</p>

<p>"In the first place, the large number of small

<h2><a name="THE_MATRIMONIAL_ORACLE" id="THE_MATRIMONIAL_ORACLE"></a>THE MATRIMONIAL ORACLE</h2>


<p>In the case of consultation upon the subject of
marriages in general, the Consultant should be
withdrawn from the pack, inasmuch as it is necessary
that the couple should be of the same color,
in order that a marriage be formed.</p>

<p>Should the young lady be a blonde who consults
the oracle upon questions of marriage, she should
pick out the jack of hearts and the queen of hearts,
and taking these two cards from out of the pack,
place them aside; then, let her shuffle the cards
well and again pick out eleven, which are in like
manner set aside. Then take up the jack and
queen of hearts and replace them among the remaining
cards in the pack, shuffle them again,
place them in succession in a line from right to
left. It is necessary so that the marriage be an
accomplished fact, that a quint, or five cards in
hearts, appear in the lay-out, and, if it be found at
the end of the deal at your left, the marriage will
be a certainty; but, should the nine of diamonds
or the seven of spades be placed in front, the marriage
will be most certainly delayed; should the
nine of diamonds alone appear, the delay will be
not over serious; but should, in place of these cards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
there be found the king of spades inverted, or three
tens, the marriage will never come off.</p>

<p>If the lady be a brunette she will take the jack
of clubs, and, if very dark, the jack of spades as
her representative husband, and represent herself
by a queen of corresponding color, always taking
care that the card ordinarily used as the Consultant
be retired from the pack.</p>

<p>Should a widow desire to contract a second marriage,
she represents herself as the queen of clubs
and her future husband as the king of clubs, which
cards should be retired and placed aside. Then
the pack is shuffled well and dealt upon the table,
face downward, in five rows; take these up again in
a reversed manner, shuffle them well and cause the
consultant to cut, and to select eleven from the
pack, which are to be put aside. Then retake the
king and queen of clubs, and place them among the
remainder of the pack, whence the eleven have been
withdrawn; shuffle well and again let them be cut,
and then deal, placing the first one dealt upon the
table directly in front of you in an isolated position&mdash;this
is the surprise. Deal the others and place
them in a single line below the surprise card on the
table, ranging from right to left, one by one. Turn
over all the cards except the surprise, which is only
to be consulted after the rest. Read the cards
thus placed likewise from right to left, and study
their significations well. It is necessary, in order
that the widow's desire for a second marriage be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
successful, that the queen of spades come out inverted,
that the king of the same color likewise appear,
and that the jack of spades be at the side of
the ace of spades or of hearts, and under this combination
her second marriage is an assured fact.
Should the ace of spades emerge near the jack, it
will also be necessary that the ace of hearts come
out to effect an alliance; but, if the consultant
have three tens before her, the marriage will not
occur; and, should the nine of spades come out, it
denotes absolute failure. Again, if instead of these
cards the eight of clubs and the eight of hearts appear,
the marriage will be a great success. Great
care should be observed in noticing whether three
eights appear behind the Consultant, for in that instance
the marriage will not be a happy one.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STAR_METHOD" id="THE_STAR_METHOD"></a>THE STAR METHOD</h2>


<p>We will suppose the person making the essay to
be a widow, and consequently represented by the
queen of spades. This card is, therefore, to be
withdrawn from the pack, and laid face uppermost
upon the table. The remaining thirty-one cards
are then to be well shuffled, cut, the topmost card
withdrawn and placed lengthwise, and face uppermost,
above the head of the queen of spades. The
cards are to be shuffled, cut, and the topmost card
withdrawn, twelve more times, the manner of their
arrangement being this: The queen of spades in
the center, the first card lengthwise above her head,
the second ditto at her feet, the third on her right
side, the fourth on her left, the fifth placed upright
above the first, the sixth ditto below the second, the
seventh at the right of the third, the eighth at the
left of the fourth, the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and
twelfth, at the four corners, and the thirteenth
across the center card&mdash;the queen of spades&mdash;thus
forming a star. (See engraving.) We will
suppose the fourteenth card to be the queen of
spades, which represents the person making the essay;
then&mdash;1. Ace of hearts; 2. King of clubs; 3.
Ten of clubs; 4. Nine of diamonds; 5. Queen of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
clubs; 6. Eight of hearts; 7. Ten of spades; 8.
Jack of clubs; 9. Seven of clubs; 10. Ten of
hearts; 11. Jack of diamonds; 12. Eight of diamonds;
13. Nine of clubs. These being placed at
right angles, the person consulting them takes them
up two by two, beginning with those last laid down.</p>

<p>The first card, 12, the eight of diamonds, and the
one in the opposite corner, viz., 11, the jack of
diamonds, read&mdash;"Overtures will be made&mdash;jack
of diamonds&mdash;by a fair young man&mdash;next two
cards, 10 and 9, ten of hearts&mdash;which will prove
unsuccessful&mdash;seven of clubs&mdash;on account of
something connected with money. Next two cards,
8 and 7, the jack of clubs&mdash;a clever dark young
man&mdash;ten of spades&mdash;will be greatly grieved by,
6&mdash;eight of hearts, a fair girl to whom he is attached.
Next two cards, 5 and 4, the queen of
clubs&mdash;a dark woman&mdash;nine of diamonds&mdash;will
be annoyed at not receiving, 3&mdash;ten of clubs&mdash;a
sum of money&mdash;next two cards, 2 and 1, the king
of clubs&mdash;which was to have been sent her by a
generous dark man, who is fond of obliging his
friends&mdash;ace of hearts&mdash;it will at last arrive, accompanied
by a love-letter&mdash;13th card, placed
across the queen of spades, nine of clubs&mdash;and be
the cause of unexpected gain to the person consulting
the cards."</p>

<h2><a name="SHORTER_STAR_METHOD" id="SHORTER_STAR_METHOD"></a>SHORTER STAR METHOD</h2>


<p>The shorter and simpler star method surrounds
the card representing the person trying his or her
fortune with a less number of cards. The cards are
shuffled and cut as before described, and the topmost
one withdrawn. We will suppose the center
card to be the jack of clubs, representing a dark
young man. The first topmost one proves to be
the ace of clubs and is placed above the head of the
jack. The second, the eight of hearts, is placed
at his feet; the third, the jack of diamonds, at his
right; the fourth, the queen of spades, at his left.
These are now read: Ace of clubs&mdash;"you will
soon receive a letter which will give you great pleasure"&mdash;eight
of hearts&mdash;"from a fair girl"&mdash;jack
of diamonds&mdash;"a man in uniform"&mdash;queen of
spades&mdash;"and a malicious widow will seek to injure

<p>Having finished all the different methods of laying

are done in various methods, and each is given in
order.</p>



<h3><a name="WISH_NO_I" id="WISH_NO_I"></a>WISH NO. I.</h3>


<p>The pack of thirty-two selected cards having
been well shuffled and cut, proceed by turning them
up by threes; if an ace appears amongst the three,
those three cards must be taken out; and if the nine
of hearts and the significator appear, they must
also be taken out with the cards that accompany
them. This operation has to be repeated three
times, and if in the three times the four aces, the
significator and the nine of hearts come out in
eleven or nine cards, then the wish is taken to be
certain; if they do not appear under twelve or fifteen,
it is said the wish will not come to pass. To
make the meaning perfectly clear, we will suppose
that a dark man, represented by the king of clubs,
is making the essay. Having well shuffled and cut
the cards, they must be turned up in threes.</p>

<p>In the first come the king of diamonds, ace of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
spades, and king of clubs&mdash;the person who is making
the essay; the next three are king and queen of
spades and ten of diamonds&mdash;these are useless;
the next three, the ten of hearts, six of diamonds
and king of hearts&mdash;these are laid on one side;
then the seven and eight of spades and ace of diamonds&mdash;these
are withdrawn and are put over the
other three, with the ace and significator; the next
three&mdash;nine of diamonds, eight of clubs and ace of
clubs, these come out; likewise the jack of clubs, ten
of spades, and ace of hearts, and the two left are
the jack of spades and nine of hearts&mdash;the other
cards are useless. Fourteen cards are now left,
they are shuffled and cut, and again dealt in
threes.</p>

<p>The ace of spades, nine of hearts, king of spades
remain; the next three, ten of spades, ace of hearts
and nine of diamonds also remain. The following
triplet: king of diamonds, king of clubs and jack of
clubs all come out. The seven of spades, ace of diamonds
and eight of clubs remain, as also the two
last&mdash;eight of spades and ace of clubs. This
makes eleven cards, so that the wish is considered
to be gained; but if it is tried the third time, and
more cards come out, then it is supposed that it will
be very speedily accomplished.</p>



<h3><a name="WISH_NO_II" id="WISH_NO_II"></a>WISH NO. II.</h3>


<p>Shuffle and cut the pack of thirty-two selected
cards.   Put them together, and turn up in threes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Supposing there should be two of one suit, and one
of another, the highest is taken out. Should there
be three of one suit, all are to be withdrawn and
laid on the table in front of the dealer, in the shape
of a semi-circle or horse shoe. If three of equal
value, such as three kings, or three tens, they are
likewise to come out. The pack is gone through,
then shuffled and cut again. When the end of the
pack is arrived at, this is repeated a third time, acting
in the same manner. Now count from the significator,
or if that should not appear naturally,
use the jack (which is taken to represent the
thoughts of the person consulting); seven are
counted each way till it is come back to, then the
cards are paired from end to end, being read as arrived
at; then all the cards are shuffled together, cut
in three, and dealt out in packets of four, face
downward. Each packet is taken up and looked
through, the cards being turned up one by one till
an ace is come to. Should there be no ace in the
parcel it is put on one side&mdash;it is useless. The
cards are shuffled and cut again, being turned up
as before, and dealt in three packets, stopping each
time at the ace, as before. The third time they are
shuffled but <i>not</i> cut, and dealt in packets of two,
and proceeded with as before. Should the four aces
(in the last deal) turn up without another card, the
wish is supposed to be sure, and to come at once.
If they come out with hearts, or diamonds, there
will be some delay, but if the nine or seven of spades<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
makes its appearance with the aces, then it is said
to be a sign of disappointment.</p>



<h3><a name="WISH_NO_III" id="WISH_NO_III"></a>WISH NO. III.</h3>


<p>A pack is taken of thirty-two selected cards, and
cut with the left hand; thirteen cards are then dealt
out. If amongst these is to be found one or more
aces, lay them aside. The remaining ones are shuffled
and cut and thirteen again dealt; the aces are
withdrawn as before, and again shuffled, cut and
dealt. If in these three deals all four aces make
their appearance, it is supposed that the wish will
be granted. If all the aces come at the first deal,
the answer is taken to be in the highest degree favorable.
If in the three times only one or two appear,
it is considered that the wish will not be
granted.</p>



<h3><a name="WISH_NO_IV" id="WISH_NO_IV"></a>WISH NO. IV.</h3>


<p>A pack of thirty-two selected cards is shuffled
and cut, the consultant wishing all the time. They
are laid out in two rows of four each, face downwards.
When two pairs come up, they must be
covered by the cards held in the dealer's hand.
Should it be possible to cover each pair&mdash;such as
two kings, two queens, etc., it is supposed that the
wish will be granted. If the cards do not pair
easily, it is said the wish will not come to pass, or,
at any rate, not for a long period.</p>

<p>The following is taken to show whether the wish
will be granted: The cards are well shuffled, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
consultant keeping his thoughts all the time fixed
upon whatever wish he may have formed; the cards
are cut once, and the card cut is noted; they are
shuffled again and dealt out into three parcels&mdash;each
of these being examined in turn, and if it is
found that the card turned up next, either the one
representing the dealer or the person who is consulting
him&mdash;the ace of hearts or the nine of hearts,
it is said that the wish will be granted. If it be in
the same parcel with any of these, without being
next to them, it is supposed there is a chance of
the wish coming to pass at some more distant period;
but if the nine of spades makes its appearance,
it is taken that a disappointment is possible.</p>



<h3><a name="WISH_NO_V" id="WISH_NO_V"></a>WISH NO. V.</h3>


<p>The pack of thirty-two selected cards, as in the
foregoing method, is taken, shuffled and cut; then
the four aces are taken out, the significator, or the
person for whom the dealer is acting, and anything
he wants to know about&mdash;such as money, then the
ten of diamonds would be selected; if about a man,
any king; if about a woman, any queen; if about
business, the ten of clubs. These are shuffled after
having been withdrawn, without cutting, and the
nine of spades, which is the disappointment card, is
also added to the aces, etc., in all seven cards, laying
them face downwards on the table. Then the
remainder are taken, shuffled well, and turned up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
threes twice, the one following being the seventh.
The pack is gone through like this, and when the
nine of hearts appears whatever number that falls
on in the twenty-five cards remaining. When
one, two, three, four, five, six or seven, it must fall
on the card drawn out by the seven cards abstracted
thus; if it should fall on No. 1 and that happens
on an ace, it is favorable, and if he should chance
on an ace, or his wish, or anything but the disappointment
card (nine of spades), the wish will be
realized.</p>

<p>First of all, the four aces are taken out, and the
nine of spades, (the disappointment card); then,
supposing the dealer is acting for a fair man, or a
soldier, who is anxious to know whether he will get
his wish. We will imagine he has invested a sum
of money, and he wishes to know whether it is a
good one; or that he hopes for a legacy and is anxious
to know if he will get it. The king of diamonds
(representing the fair man), and the ten of
diamonds, the money card, should therefore be
taken out. These are added to the four aces and
the nine of spades. These are well shuffled, but not
cut, and laid face downwards on the table, like the
following:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 40%;">
<img src="images/i_150.png" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p>These represent the four aces, the disappointment
card and the inquirer and his wish. The remaining
cards are now taken and turned up three
at a time. We will suppose the first three are the
nine, seven and eight of clubs; the next three the
ten and jack of hearts, and eight of diamonds; and
the seventh card, the queen of clubs&mdash;these are
passed by. Begin again, counting one. We will
suppose the next three are the eight of spades, the
seven of clubs and the nine of hearts. Three are
then counted from those laid face downwards on the
table, and that card is turned up&mdash;we will suppose
that to be the king of diamonds; the cards
turned up by threes are gathered together and shuffled,
and turned up by sevens as before. Should
the nine of hearts fall on the fourth card the second
time, that is to be turned up&mdash;we will suppose that
to be the ace of diamonds. Proceed again as be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>fore,
and this time we will imagine the nine of hearts
to fall on the seventh&mdash;this may be the ten of diamonds&mdash;so
that it could be said to the persons
consulting that it is said he will get his wish; but
supposing the nine of hearts to fall on the fifth
card, and that turns out to be the nine of spades, he
will be disappointed; and should it happen that <i>in
the first reading</i> the nine of hearts should come on,
we will say, the first card, which might prove the
nine of spades, then it is no use continuing the three
times, as it is supposed there is no chance whatever
of the wish being realized.</p>



<h3><a name="WISH_NO_VI" id="WISH_NO_VI"></a>WISH NO. VI.</h3>


<p>The whole pack of fifty-two cards is taken, shuffled
and cut in two packets. They are now laid out
face uppermost, in three rows of four cards each, in
all twelve cards. If in the first twelve cards any
court cards appear, they are taken out, filling up the
spaces with fresh cards; should these again be court
cards, they are abstracted as before, filling in the
spaces as described; if not, they are thus counted:
Eleven must be made up of any <i>two</i> cards, such as
an ace and ten (ace counting as one), and covered,
or two and nine, each card being covered as counted,
three and eight, four and seven, five and six, etc.
If a court card appears, it is a stop and counts as
nothing. If, as the cards are covered, eleven can
be made out of any of the two cards, and continued
to the end, exhausting all the cards, it is taken that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the wish will be gained; in that case all the court
cards ought to be on the top, as those cast aside at
first are used at the last, to cover each two cards as
they count eleven. If the court cards cannot be
got to come out at the end, the wish is supposed
to be delayed, and if eleven cannot be made from
nearly the beginning, it is said, the wish will not be
realized at all. To explain the meaning more
clearly, the following diagram is given. We will
suppose they are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/i_152.png" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>There are now removed the three court cards,
viz.:&mdash;the jack of clubs in the first row, the jack
of diamonds in the second, and the king of diamonds
in the third. These are replaced by the
nine of clubs in the first row, five of spades in the
second, and six of hearts in the third. The cards
are now to be covered. In the first row, four and
seven of spades, making respectively eleven covered
by ten of clubs and ten of spades. Eleven is now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
made, where possible, from all three rows. In the
second row will be found the six and five of spades;
these are covered by two and one of clubs. In the
third row, one of clubs and ten of hearts, covered
by seven of diamonds and three of spades. In the
same row, five of diamonds and six of hearts, covered
by the two of diamonds and king of hearts. In
the first and second rows, nine of clubs and two of
spades, covered by the four and eight of diamonds.
In the second row, three and eight of diamonds, covered
by the jack of hearts and queen of clubs. In
the first and second row, the one and ten of spades,
covered by the three of hearts and three of spades.
In the first and third rows, four of clubs and seven
of diamonds, covered by the ten of diamonds and
nine of hearts. In the third row, nine of hearts
and two of diamonds, covered by the five of clubs
and ace of diamonds. In the first and third rows,
ten of clubs and ace of diamonds, covered by the
seven of hearts and queen of diamonds. In the
first row, four of diamonds and seven of hearts, covered
by the eight and five of hearts. In the first
and third rows, eight of hearts and three of clubs,
covered by the seven of clubs and jack of spades.
In the first and second rows, seven of clubs and
four of hearts, covered by the two of clubs and eight
of spades. In the first and second rows, the three
of hearts and eight of spades, covered by the king
and nine of spades. In the first row, two of clubs
and nine of spades, covered by the ace of hearts and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
six of diamonds. In the first row, again, the ace of
hearts and ten of diamonds, covered by the two of
hearts and six of clubs. In the first and third
rows, five and six of clubs, covered by the nine of
diamonds and queen of hearts. In the first row,
five of hearts and six of diamonds, covered by the
king and eight of clubs. Then in the first and second
rows, the eight of clubs and three of spades, as
there is only one card remaining, viz.:&mdash;the queen
of spades, the three other cards to be covered, those
put aside at first are taken up, the last two to be
covered being the nine of diamonds and two of
hearts, covered by the jack of diamonds and jack
of clubs. In this case the wish is supposed to be
realized; but in some cases it will be found that it
has not made up the number eleven in the two cards,
and then it is taken that the wish may be either delayed
or not fulfilled.</p>

<p class="center"><i>By Which Fortunes Are Told in a Most Singular
and Diverting Manner</i>.</p>



<h3><a name="LOVERS_HEARTS" id="LOVERS_HEARTS"></a>LOVERS' HEARTS.</h3>


<p>Four young persons, but not more, may play at
this game, or three by making a dummy hand.
This game is played exactly the same in every
game, making the queen, which is called Venus,
above the ace; the ace in this game only stands for
one, and hearts must be led off by the person next
the dealer. He or she who gets most tricks this
way (each taking up their own and no partnership)
is supposed to have most lovers, and the king
and queen of hearts in one hand is said to denote
matrimony at hand; but woe to the unlucky one
who gets no tricks at the deal, or does not hold a
heart in his or her hand; to them are ascribed misfortune
in love and long tarry before they marry.</p>




<h3><a name="LOVES_LOTTERY" id="LOVES_LOTTERY"></a>LOVE'S LOTTERY.</h3>


<p>Let each one present deposit any sum agreed on,
or a certain number of counters; put a complete
pack of cards well shuffled in a bag, let the parties
stand in a circle and the bag being handed round,
each draw three; pairs of any kind are supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
to be favorable omens of some good fortune about
to occur to the party and get back from the pool
the sum that each agreed to pay. The king of
hearts is here made the god of love, and claims
double, and professes to give a faithful swain to the
fair one who has the good fortune to draw him; if
Venus, the queen of hearts, is with him, it is the conquering
prize, and clears the pool; fives and nines
are reckoned crosses and misfortunes, and pay a
forfeit of the sum agreed on to the pool, besides
the usual stipend at each new game; three nines at
one draw is supposed to portend the lady will be an
old maid, three fives, a bad husband.</p>



<h3><a name="MATRIMONY" id="MATRIMONY"></a>MATRIMONY.</h3>


<p>Let three, five, or seven young women stand in
a circle, and draw a card out of a bag. It is taken
that she who gets the highest card will be the first
married of the company, whether she be at the present
time maid, wife, or widow, and she who has the
lowest has the longest time to stay ere the sun shines
on her wedding day; she who draws the ace of
spades will never bear the name of wife; and she
who has the nine of hearts in this trial will have
one lover too many to her sorrow.</p>



<h3><a name="CUPIDS_PASTIME" id="CUPIDS_PASTIME"></a>CUPID'S PASTIME.</h3>


<p>Amusement may be caused by this game to all
those playing, and at the same time it is supposed
that some curious particulars may be learned concerning
the future fates of the consultants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Several may play at the game, it requiring no special
number, only leaving out nine cards on the table
not exposed to view; each person puts a trifling
sum in the pool, and the dealer double. The ace
of diamonds is made principal, and takes all the
other aces, etc.; twos and threes in hand are said
to show luck; fours, a continuance in the present
state; fives, trouble; sixes, profit; sevens, worries;
eights, disappointment; nines, surprises; tens, settlements;
jacks, sweethearts; kings and queens,
friends and acquaintances; ace of spades, death; ace
of clubs, a letter; and the ace of diamonds with ten
of hearts, marriage.</p>

<p>The ace of diamonds being played first, or should
it be amongst the nine, the dealer calls for the queen
of hearts, which takes next. If the ace be not out
and the queen conquers, it is supposed that the
person who played her will be married that year
without a doubt, though it may perhaps seem unlikely
at that time; but if she loses her queen, she
must wait longer. The ace and queen being called,
the rest go in rotation as at whist; kings taking
queens, queens jacks, and so on, and the more tricks
taken, the more money the winner gets off the board
on the division; those who hold the nine of spades
are to pay a penny to the board, and it is said they
will have some trouble; but the fortunate fair one
who holds the queen and jack of hearts in the same
hand is supposed soon to be married, or if she is
already within the pale of matrimony, a great rise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
in life by means of her husband; those who hold the
ace of diamonds and queen of hearts clear the
money off the board and end that game; it also
professes to betoken great prosperity.</p>



<h3><a name="WEDDING_BELLS" id="WEDDING_BELLS"></a>WEDDING BELLS.</h3>


<p>You select the four kings from a pack, and lay
them side by side in a row upon the table.</p>

<p>The lady who wishes to know her fortune gives
to each of these cards the name of some gentleman
of her acquaintance who might be likely to woo her
in marriage. It is usual to pronounce these names
aloud before the company. The name given to the
king of hearts is, however, an exception. This secret
the lady keeps to herself. To these four kings,
you can also add a queen, which then denotes the
old maid.</p>

<p>Now, take the rest of the pack, shuffle it thoroughly,
let the person in question cut three times
and commence. Under each of the above-named
picture-cards you lay a card in turn, and as often
as a spade is placed under a spade, a heart under
a heart, <i>et cetera</i>, that is, as often as a card of the
same suit is placed under one of these picture-cards,
the picture-card is turned from its position.</p>

<p>The first time it takes a direction from left to
right, the second time it lies upside down, the third
time it is raised again to a position from right to
left, and the fourth and last time it regains its former
upright position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>That one of the four kings who, after these different
changes, first resumes his upright position, is
to be the happy husband. If it should happen to
be the old maid, you can imagine what is in store for
you.</p>



<h3><a name="MARRIAGE_QUESTIONS" id="MARRIAGE_QUESTIONS"></a>MARRIAGE QUESTIONS.</h3>


<p>After having learned from the cards who is to be
the husband, the questions next asked are, usually:
How much will he love his wife, why he marries her,
and what is his profession. These questions are
answered in the following manner:</p>

<p>Gather up the cards, shuffle them thoroughly, and
let the person cut them three times. Then tell off
the cards upon the table, as you recite the following
sentence:</p>

<p class="poem">
Heartily, painfully,<br />
Beyond all measure.<br />
By fits and starts.<br />
Not a bit in the world.<br />
</p>

<p>You repeat this sentence until the king of hearts
makes his appearance. If it happens that, as you
lay this upon the table, you pronounce the word
"heartily" he will love his future wife heartily,
and so on.</p>

<p>Now as to why he marries her. Count off the
cards upon the table, while you repeat the following
sentence:</p>

<p class="poem">
For love, for her beauty,<br />
For his parents' command,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>For the bright, golden dollars,<br />
For counsel of friends.<br />
</p>

<p>The sentence by which you discover what is his
profession is the following:</p>

<p class="poem">
Gentleman, alderman, clergyman, doctor,<br />
Merchant, broker, professor, major,<br />
Mechanic, lawyer, shipmaster, tailor.<br />
</p>

<p>This method of telling fortunes is very entertaining
in society, when you have not the book to find
more particular answers.</p>
